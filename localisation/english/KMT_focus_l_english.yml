 wisconsin.1.t:0 "The State of our State"
 wisconsin.1.d:0 "As a new era rises over America, we must address the situation Wisconsin now finds itself in. Having been created by an almost exclusively anti-GLAR coalition, we must decide how this Coalition of the Willing should lead. The traditional answer would be to focus on political stability—keeping our people secure and well-fed. However, exceptional times call for exceptional measures: even though they may lack military experience, should our political class lead from the front, inspiring morale in the troops and hope in the people?"
 wisconsin.1.a:0 "Our leadership will be political"

 wisconsin.3.d:0 "When the delegation arrived, there was a sense of optimism in the air, smiles all around and a general feeling of goodwill. After hours of negotiation, most of the plan had been laid out: the [KMT.GetName] would receive all Wisconsinite territory, along with the Illinois lands currently controlled by the [GLA.GetName]. In turn, the [DET.GetName] was awarded the former territory of Michigan, as well as the Indianan and Ohioan regions held by the [GLA.GetName].\n\nThe meeting was nearing its end when a thought crossed [KMT.GetLeader]’s mind: the Upper Peninsula. Without it, we would remain just as exposed as we are now, if this alliance collapses in the future. And that strip of land... Wasn’t it artificially handed to Michigan back in 1836?\n\nIs it time to right that wrong?"

An idea of a small raid into the [GLA.GetName] was floated arround. With the objective of gaining experience and steal some weapons, many are supporting this initiative. On the other hand, the skeptics argue that we should not risk human and material loss on such a small endeavor.\n\nWhat should we do?"

The Weather Underground Organization, however, stands as something of an exception. While not fully aligned with the Coalition of the Willing, they have cooperated with our leadership in the fight against [GLA.GetName].\nThey are undeniably useful, and we cannot afford to disarm or dismiss them, at least not yet. If we choose to leave them alone, they may continue their efforts, but without state support, their impact will be limited. On the other hand, if we back them officially, we risk empowering a group that may turn on us once [GLA.GetName] is no longer a threat. This is a delicate matter.\n\nShould we support them or simply leave them be?"
 wisconsin.18.a:0 "We need all help we can get"
 wisconsin.18.b:0 "We really shouldn't embolden extremists"

A coalition of Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Progressives, Catholics, and elements of the Judicial System was formed in western Wisconsin to restore order to the region. It is now our duty to consider the political, diplomatic, and military solutions necessary to reforge our state."
 KMT_ultimatum_to_milley:0 "An Ultimatum to the Ice Legion"
 KMT_ultimatum_to_milley_desc:0 "The troops led by Mark Milley crossed the Great Lakes in order to create a new front against the Loyalists, trying lo link up with the NPA. Having this failed, they ended stranded in northern Minnesota and in the northwestern part of our State. If we want to defeat the GLAR we must have all possible resources to do so. Now we should take advantage of the war in Minnesota and demand our rightfull land!"
 KMT_focus_on_what_we_have:0 "Focus on What We Have"
 KMT_focus_on_what_we_have_desc:0 "Even though we could have taken advantage of the situation in Minnesota, it is better for us to focus on the true goal: defeating the GLAR. Perhaps after we defeat them we can look back on what is rightfully ours."
 KMT_prepare_for_the_inevitable:0 "Prepare for the Inevitable"
 KMT_prepare_for_the_inevitable_desc:0 "So far, our sole reason to exist is to fight the disorder that the Libetarian Party of the Great Lakes instilled in, not just our State, but the Great Lakes region.

 KMT_rally_the_wisconsinites:0 "Rally the Wisconsinites"

 KMT_what_to_do_with_the_militant_militia_desc:0 "We stand in the midst of a dilemma: part of our fight against [GLA.GetName] depends on the Revived Weather Underground Organization.

The path forward is uncertain, and the risks on both sides are clear."
 KMT_the_forest_division:0 "The Forest Division"
 KMT_the_forest_division_desc:0 "Surrounded by dense forests, our military must adapt to the terrain that defines our homeland.

These troops will gain the edge needed to outmaneuver and overwhelm the enemy in wooded terrain, turning nature into a weapon on our side."
 KMT_fortification_efforts:0 "Fortify the Border"
 KMT_fortification_efforts_desc:0 "Having a secure and fortified border is the first step in ensuring the [GLA.GetName]'s armies don't just walk right in.

 KMT_the_fight_for_order:0 "The Fight for Order"
 KMT_the_fight_for_order_desc:0 "What are we fighting for? Not for America, at least, not yet. Right now, our struggle is against those who poison our land with chaos, degeneracy, and anarchism.
