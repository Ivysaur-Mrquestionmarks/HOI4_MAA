 ### IDEAS ###
 KMT_coalition_of_the_willing:0 "Coalition of the Willing"
 KMT_coalition_of_the_willing_desc:0 "The Coalition of the Willing is the current political landscape of our State. Republicans, democrats and progressives, with the support of other institutions like the Catholic and Juditiary System have put aside their differences in a rally against the GLAR."
 KMT_weather_underground_militia:0 "Weather Underground Militia"
 KMT_weather_underground_militia_desc:0 "The original Weather Underground was a Marxist militant organization in the 70's. They advocated for the overthrow of American imperialism and capitalism, aligning with global anti-colonial movement. Now, in the aftermath of the 2020 election, the organization was revived as a militia. Though advocating for the same things that moved them in the past, as of right now, they are helping our coalition in the common goal: defeating the GLAR."
 KMT_struggling_industry:0 "Struggling Industry"
 KMT_struggling_industry_desc:0 "The Wisconsinite industrial capacity has taken a hit since the collapse of the United States, with the GLAR controlling the industrial centers and Milley's forces occupying the northwestern part of our State, we are left with a somewhat poor base of industrial support."

 ### EVENTS ###
 wisconsin.1.t:0 "The State of our State"
 wisconsin.1.d:0 "As a new era rises over America, we must address the situation Wisconsin now finds itself in. Having been created by an almost exclusively anti-GLAR coalition, we must decide how this Coalition of the Willing should lead. The traditional answer would be to focus on political stability—keeping our people secure and well-fed. However, exceptional times call for exceptional measures: even though they may lack military experience, should our political class lead from the front, inspiring morale in the troops and hope in the people?"
 wisconsin.1.a:0 "Our leadership will be political"
 wisconsin.1.b:0 "We must lead from the front"

 KMT_the_state_of_wisconsin_desc:0 "We were born in opposition to the chaos that the GLAR brought upon this land. A coalition of Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Progressives, Catholics, and elements of the Judicial System was formed in western Wisconsin to restore order to the region. It is now our duty to consider the political, diplomatic, and military solutions necessary to reforge our state."

Now we should take advantage of the war in Minnesota and demand our rightfull land!"
 KMT_focus_on_what_we_have:0 "Focus on What We Have"
 KMT_focus_on_what_we_have_desc:0 "Even though we could have taken advantage of the situation in Minnesota, it is better for us to focus on the true goal: defeating the GLAR. Perhaps after we defeat them we can look back on what is rightfully ours."

 KMT_prepare_for_the_inevitable_desc:0 "So far, our sole reason to exist is to fight the disorder that the Libetarian Party of the Great Lakes instilled in, not just our State, but the Great Lakes region.
