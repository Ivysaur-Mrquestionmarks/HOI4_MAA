In turn, the [DET.GetName] was awarded the former territory of Michigan, as well as the Indianan and Ohioan regions held by the [GLA.GetName].\n\nThe meeting was nearing its end when a thought crossed [KMT.GetLeader]’s mind: the Upper Peninsula.

 wisconsin.15.d:0 "This afternoon, the remnants of our raid party returned from [GLA.GetName]'s territory in defeat. Though some experience was gained, the operation stands as a somber setback for our cause."
 wisconsin.15.a:0 "Curses"

 #event 16: Successful Raid (GLA Prespective)
 wisconsin.16.t:0 "The [KMT.GetName] has Raided Us!"
 wisconsin.16.d:0 "A small party of Wisconsinite raiders crossed into our zone of control and wreaked havoc. Under the cover of darkness, they launched a swift and brutal assault, stealing weapons from our outposts, killing several members of our security forces, and terrifying the local population."
 wisconsin.16.a:0 "Damn"

 #event 17: Failed Raid (GLA Prespective)
 wisconsin.17.t:0 "The [KMT.GetName] Tried to Raid Us!"
 wisconsin.17.d:0 "A small party of Wisconsinite raiders crossed into our zone of control and attempted to wreak havoc on our land. We believe their objective was to steal weapons, kill members of our security forces, and sow fear among our citizens. Fortunately, their plan was foiled, and they were swiftly dealt with. Let this serve as a warning: no one challenges the [GLA.GetName] without consequences."
 wisconsin.17.a:0 "Fools"

 #event 18: Militia Dilema
 wisconsin.18.t:0 "What to do With the Weathermen?"
 wisconsin.18.d:0 "In opposition to the chaos unleashed by the GLAR, various groups have united to restore order to the state. The Weather Underground Organization, however, stands as something of an exception. While not fully aligned with the Coalition of the Willing, they have cooperated with our leadership in the fight against [GLA.GetName].\nThey are undeniably useful, and we cannot afford to disarm or dismiss them, at least not yet. If we choose to leave them alone, they may continue their efforts, but without state support, their impact will be limited. On the other hand, if we back them officially, we risk empowering a group that may turn on us once [GLA.GetName] is no longer a threat. This is a delicate matter.\n\nShould we support them or simply leave them be?"
 wisconsin.18.a:0 "We need all help we can get"
 wisconsin.18.b:0 "We really shouldn't embolden extremists"

 #event 19: Our Future
 wisconsin.19.t:0 "Our Future"
 wisconsin.19.d:0 "Only days after our great victory over the [GLA.GetName], the flame that once united us begins to flicker. Republicans and Democrats have resumed their bickering over economic policy. Catholics and Progressives clash over social values. The judiciary appears more interested in expanding its own influence than delivering justice. And the militias... as always, they act without restraint, fueling unrest and radicalization across the land. They will be the first to be dealt with. Now, [KMT.GetLeader] must turn inward, to reflect not only on the path ahead for the [KMT.GetName], but on his own future in this fragile new order."
 wisconsin.19.a:0 "[KMT.GetLeader] orders the Coalition to stand by"

 #event 20: Disband succesfull
 wisconsin.20.t:0 "The Weathermen Disband!"
 wisconsin.20.d:0 "As we ordered the Weather Underground Militia to lay down their arms, some feared retaliation. That did not come to pass. In truth, thanks to the coalition's earlier difficult but wise decision not to embolden them during our time of need, the militia struggled to grow and failed to sink their tentacles deep into our institutions and communities. Though a few minor protests were raised, this outcome marks yet another success for the coalition."
 wisconsin.20.a:0 "Great!"

 #event 21: Disband unsuccesfull
 wisconsin.21.t:0 "The Weathermen Refuse to Disarm!"
 wisconsin.21.d:0 "As we attempted to disarm the Weather Underground Militia, our worst fears came true. Empowered by the coalition’s earlier decision to support them during the war, they had grown bold—and deeply rooted. There is no denying their role was crucial in securing our victory against the [GLA.GetName]; their fighters bled and triumphed alongside our own. But that very success fueled their rise. Now, as we seek to restore order and stability, their leaders refuse to stand down. They claim betrayal, rallying supporters with cries of revolution and justice. What once seemed like a necessary alliance has turned into a dangerous insurrection. The price of our past reliance on radical allies has come due."
 wisconsin.21.a:0 "We will have to do it the hard way"

 #event 22: Civil war breakaway gets cores (couldn't manage to work in wisconsin.21 + not visible to player)

 #event 23: elections
 wisconsin.23.t:0 "A New Direction for Wisconsin"
 wisconsin.23.d:0 "With the Coalition of the Willing officially dissolved, Wisconsin holds fresh elections. Two leading members of the Coalition emerged to lead the state into a new era: Senator Ron Johnson, representing the trumpist case, and Senator Tammy Baldwin, a defender of the bidenist ideals. The votes have been counted. Who won?"
 wisconsin.23.a:0 "§RThe Republican, Ron Johnson§!"
 wisconsin.23.b:0 "§BThe Democrat, Tammy Baldwin§!"

 #event 24: elections - trump interferes
 wisconsin.24.t:0 ""Democratic" Elections"
 wisconsin.24.d:0 "We were supposed to hold free and fair elections. However, with Trump’s growing influence already entrenched in our state, the process was anything but democratic. Amid allegations and irregularities, Ron Johnson emerged as the “elected” leader. Whether by popular support or political pressure, the result is clear."
 wisconsin.24.a:0 "Yay. Democracy..."

 #event 25: join faction - (trump/biden prespective)
 wisconsin.25.t:0 "The State of Wisconsin Seeks Alignment"
 wisconsin.25.d:0 "The [KMT.GetName] has officially reached out to our government, declaring that the time has come to reunify under a single banner. With their internal divisions resolved, they now seek to join our faction and support our leadership in restoring American order.\n\n[KMT.GetLeader] has pledged loyalty to our cause!"

 #event 26: join faction accepted
 wisconsin.26.t:0 "Accepted Into the Fold"
 wisconsin.26.d:0 "Our message has been received and accepted. The [FROM.GetName] has formally welcomed us into their faction. This marks the end of our political isolation and the beginning of a united front against those who threaten our shared vision for the country.\n\nFrom now on, our war is their war, and their enemies are ours. The [KMT.GetAdjective] people march under a broader banner once again."
 wisconsin.26.a:0 "Together, we will restore the Union"

 #event 27: ask for land (trump/biden prespective)
 wisconsin.27.t:0 "[KMT.GetNameDef] Asks for Their Rightful Land"
 wisconsin.27.d:0 "Now that [KMT.GetNameDef] is a part of our faction and we do control rightful [KMT.GetAdjective] land they have asked us to return it."
 wisconsin.27.a:0 "It is only fair"

 #event 28: rust belt mandate (trump/biden prespective)
 wisconsin.28.t:0 "Request for Rust Belt Mandate"
 wisconsin.28.d:0 "The leadership of [KMT.GetNameDef] has requested administrative authority over parts of the Rust Belt region. Their argument is based on a expressed desire to bring order and stability to those areas in our name. Granting them this mandate would bolster their strength and responsibility in the region."
 wisconsin.28.a:0 "Grant them the mandate"

 #event 28: rust belt mandate granted
 wisconsin.29.t:0 "Rust Belt Mandate Granted"
 wisconsin.29.d:0 "Our overlord has agreed to our request and granted us administrative control over the Rust Belt. This is a momentous opportunity for us to prove our competence, expand our influence, and bring order to these chaotic lands."
 wisconsin.29.a:0 "A responsibility we won’t take lightly"

 #event 30: ban abortion
 wisconsin.30.t:0 "The Abortion Debate"
 wisconsin.30.d:0 "With our new political influence, the time has come to address one of the most divisive issues in our society: abortion. The party is somewhat split between those who demand a complete ban, allowing no exceptions, and those who argue for a partial ban with limited exceptions, for cases like rape, incest and those who put the life of the mother at risk. This choice we make will shape the moral and political identity of our state."
 wisconsin.30.a:0 "Completely ban abortion"
 wisconsin.30.b:0 "A partial ban with exceptions is better"

 #event 31: luber
 wisconsin.31.t:0 "The Fate of Our Forests"
 wisconsin.31.d:0 "With the expansion of the lumber industry, we face a choice that will shape both our economy and our environment. Some advocate for strict preservation, ensuring our forests remain untouched for future generations. Others propose a balanced approach, maintaining moderate logging while protecting key areas. And then there are those who push for full-scale exploitation, clearing vast tracts of land to fuel industrial growth."
 wisconsin.31.a:0 "Try to preserve the forests. Nature must endure"
 wisconsin.31.b:0 "Take a balanced approach"
 wisconsin.31.c:0 "Exploit the forests for industry"

 #event 32: Flop Fair
 wisconsin.32.t:0 "A Disappointing World's Fair"
 wisconsin.32.d:0 "The Second Chicago World's Fair failed to capture public interest. Poor planning, lackluster exhibits, and weak international participation left many visitors unimpressed. The press has been harsh, and our prestige has taken a hit."
 wisconsin.32.a:0 "Somewhat of an embarrassment"

 #event 33: Medium Fair
 wisconsin.33.t:0 "A Decent World's Fair"
 wisconsin.33.d:0 "The Second Chicago World's Fair went relatively well. While not groundbreaking, the exhibits attracted a fair number of visitors and left a generally positive impression. Some economic benefits were seen, but the event will soon be forgotten."
 wisconsin.33.a:0 "Not bad, but not great either"

 #event 34: Great Fair
 wisconsin.34.t:0 "A Glorious World's Fair"
 wisconsin.34.d:0 "The Second Chicago World's Fair was a massive success! Spectacular exhibits, international participation, and enthusiastic crowds turned the event into a cultural and economic triumph. Our nation’s prestige has soared, and we have attracted investment from across the globe."
 wisconsin.34.a:0 "A shining moment in our history!"

 KMT_the_state_of_wisconsin_desc:0 "We were born in opposition to the chaos that the GLAR brought upon this land. A coalition of Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Progressives, Catholics, and elements of the Judicial System was formed in western Wisconsin to restore order to the region. It is now our duty to consider the political, diplomatic, and military solutions necessary to reforge our state."

Having this failed, they ended stranded in northern Minnesota and in the northwestern part of our State. If we want to defeat the GLAR we must have all possible resources to do so. Now we should take advantage of the war in Minnesota and demand our rightful land!"

 KMT_prepare_for_the_inevitable_desc:0 "So far, our sole reason to exist is to fight the disorder that the Libetarian Party of the Great Lakes instilled in, not just our State, but the Great Lakes region.

Instead of direct confrontation, we will pursue a subtler tactic: entryism.
