The Weather Underground Organization, however, stands as something of an exception. While not fully aligned with the Coalition of the Willing, they have cooperated with our leadership in the fight against [GLA.GetName].\nThey are undeniably useful, and we cannot afford to disarm or dismiss them, at least not yet. If we choose to leave them alone, they may continue their efforts, but without state support, their impact will be limited. On the other hand, if we back them officially, we risk empowering a group that may turn on us once [GLA.GetName] is no longer a threat.

And the militias... as always, they act without restraint, fueling unrest and radicalization across the land. They will be the first to be dealt with.

Empowered by the coalition’s earlier decision to support them during the war, they had grown bold—and deeply rooted. There is no denying their role was crucial in securing our victory against the [GLA.GetName]; their fighters bled and triumphed alongside our own. But that very success fueled their rise. Now, as we seek to restore order and stability, their leaders refuse to stand down. They claim betrayal, rallying supporters with cries of revolution and justice. What once seemed like a necessary alliance has turned into a dangerous insurrection. The price of our past reliance on radical allies has come due."

Yet not all opposition was gone. In the chaos, a loose alliance of opportunists, fringe politicians, and disaffected public figures has declared a so-called Counter-Revolution.
