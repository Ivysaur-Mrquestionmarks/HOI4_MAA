With no clear enemy, their shared purpose has begun to dissolve. What remains is a fragile alliance caught in limbo. Uncertain whether to disband and return to infighting over policy and allegiance, or to preserve their unity at the cost of decisive action. Some whisper of reform.

### EVENTS ###
 #event 1: KMT_the_state_of_wiscosnin focus reward
 wisconsin.1.t:0 "The State of our State"
 wisconsin.1.d:0 "As a new era rises over America, we must address the situation Wisconsin now finds itself in. Having been created by an almost exclusively anti-GLAR coalition, we must decide how this Coalition of the Willing should lead. The traditional answer would be to focus on political stability—keeping our people secure and well-fed. However, exceptional times call for exceptional measures: even though they may lack military experience, should our political class lead from the front, inspiring morale in the troops and hope in the people?"
 wisconsin.1.a:0 "Our leadership will be political"
 wisconsin.1.b:0 "We must lead from the front"

 #event 2: KMT_meeting_with_detroit focus reward (DET prespective)
 wisconsin.2.t:0 "A Meeting with the [KMT.GetName]?"
 wisconsin.2.d:0 "Today, a letter from [KMT.GetLeader] arrived on [DET.GetLeader]’s desk. It calls for the dispatch of diplomats to discuss the threat posed to both nations by the [GLA.GetName]. Among other things, the letter mentions the possibility of forming an alliance and defining post-war borders."

 wisconsin.3.t:0 "The [DET.GetName] Delegation Arrives"
 wisconsin.3.d:0 "When the delegation arrived, there was a sense of optimism in the air, smiles all around and a general feeling of goodwill. After hours of negotiation, most of the plan had been laid out: the [KMT.GetName] would receive all Wisconsinite territory, along with the Illinois lands currently controlled by the [GLA.GetName]. In turn, the [DET.GetName] was awarded the former territory of Michigan, as well as the Indianan and Ohioan regions held by the [GLA.GetName].\n\nThe meeting was nearing its end when a thought crossed [KMT.GetLeader]’s mind: the Upper Peninsula. Without it, we would remain just as exposed as we are now, if this alliance collapses in the future. And that strip of land... Wasn’t it artificially handed to Michigan back in 1836?\n\nIs it time to right that wrong?"
 wisconsin.3.a:0 "Ask for the Yoop"

Suddently, a big comotion among the Wisconsinite delegation started. When in it was over, [KMT.GetLeader] asked for the Upper peninsula of the state of Michigan. Should we acquiesce?"
 wisconsin.5.a:0 "No. Also threat to pull out of the negotiations in the issue is pressed again"
 wisconsin.5.b:0 "Sounds like a fair request"
 
 #event 6: DET rejects Yoop agreement
 wisconsin.6.t:0 "[DET.GetName] Refuses to the Upper Peninsula Deal"
 wisconsin.6.d:0 "The [DET.GetName]'s diplomatic delegation has refused to agree to our request for Wisconsinite control of the Upper Peninsula. They have also threatened to pull out of the negotiations if the issue is pressed again. What should we do?"

 #event 13: Launch a Raid into GLA?
 wisconsin.13.t:0 "A Raid into the [GLA.GetName]?"
 wisconsin.13.d:0 "With the start of our Guerrilla warfare initiative, some millitary minded people have suggested that we should put our new capacities to the test. An idea of a small raid into the [GLA.GetName] was floated arround. With the objective of gaining experience and steal some weapons, many are supporting this initiative. On the other hand, the skeptics argue that we should not risk human and material loss on such a small endeavor.\n\nWhat should we do?"
 wisconsin.13.a:0 "We shouln't gamble on our security"
 wisconsin.13.b:0 "Maybe a smaller party could do the job"

 #event 16: Successful Raid (GLA Prespective)
 wisconsin.16.t:0 "The [KMT.GetName] has Raided Us!"
 wisconsin.16.d:0 "A small party of Wisconsinite raiders crossed into our zone of control and wreaked havoc.

 #event 17: Failed Raid (GLA Prespective)
 wisconsin.17.t:0 "The [KMT.GetName] Tried to Raid Us!"
 wisconsin.17.d:0 "A small party of Wisconsinite raiders crossed into our zone of control and attempted to wreak havoc on our land. We believe their objective was to steal weapons, kill members of our security forces, and sow fear among our citizens. Fortunately, their plan was foiled, and they were swiftly dealt with. Let this serve as a warning: no one challenges the [GLA.GetName] without consequences."
 wisconsin.17.a:0 "Fools"

 #event 18: Militia Dilema
 wisconsin.18.t:0 "What to do With the Weathermen?"
 wisconsin.18.d:0 "In opposition to the chaos unleashed by the GLAR, various groups have united to restore order to the state. The Weather Underground Organization, however, stands as something of an exception. While not fully aligned with the Coalition of the Willing, they have cooperated with our leadership in the fight against [GLA.GetName].\nThey are undeniably useful, and we cannot afford to disarm or dismiss them, at least not yet. If we choose to leave them alone, they may continue their efforts, but without state support, their impact will be limited. On the other hand, if we back them officially, we risk empowering a group that may turn on us once [GLA.GetName] is no longer a threat. This is a delicate matter.\n\nShould we support them or simply leave them be?"
 wisconsin.18.a:0 "We need all help we can get"
 wisconsin.18.b:0 "We really shouldn't embolden extremists"

 #event 19: Our Future
 wisconsin.19.t:0 "Our Future"
 wisconsin.19.d:0 "Only days after our great victory over the [GLA.GetName], the flame that once united us begins to flicker. Republicans and Democrats have resumed their bickering over economic policy. Catholics and Progressives clash over social values. The judiciary appears more interested in expanding its own influence than delivering justice. And the militias... as always, they act without restraint, fueling unrest and radicalization across the land. They will be the first to be dealt with. Now, [KMT.GetLeader] must turn inward, to reflect not only on the path ahead for the [KMT.GetName], but on his own future in this fragile new order."
 wisconsin.19.a:0 "[KMT.GetLeader] orders the Coalition to stand by"

 #event 20: Disband succesfull
 wisconsin.20.t:0 "The Weathermen Disband!"
 wisconsin.20.d:0 "As we ordered the Weather Underground Militia to lay down their arms, some feared retaliation. That did not come to pass. In truth, thanks to the coalition's earlier difficult but wise decision not to embolden them during our time of need, the militia struggled to grow and failed to sink their tentacles deep into our institutions and communities. Though a few minor protests were raised, this outcome marks yet another success for the coalition."
 wisconsin.20.a:0 "Great!"

 #event 21: Disband unsuccesfull
 wisconsin.21.t:0 "The Weathermen Refuse to Disarm!"
 wisconsin.21.d:0 "As we attempted to disarm the Weather Underground Militia, our worst fears came true. Empowered by the coalition’s earlier decision to support them during the war, they had grown bold—and deeply rooted. There is no denying their role was crucial in securing our victory against the [GLA.GetName]; their fighters bled and triumphed alongside our own. But that very success fueled their rise. Now, as we seek to restore order and stability, their leaders refuse to stand down. They claim betrayal, rallying supporters with cries of revolution and justice. What once seemed like a necessary alliance has turned into a dangerous insurrection. The price of our past reliance on radical allies has come due."
 wisconsin.21.a:0 "We will have to do it the hard way"

 #event 22: Civil war breakaway gets cores (couldn't manage to work in wisconsin.21 + should not be visible to any player)
 wisconsin.22.t:0 "Cores From the Skies"
 wisconsin.22.d:0 "Thanks Karl Marx who art in heaven."
 wisconsin.22.a:0 "Yay"

 #event 23: elections
 wisconsin.23.t:0 "A New Direction for Wisconsin"
 wisconsin.23.d:0 "With the Coalition of the Willing officially dissolved, Wisconsin holds fresh elections. Two leading members of the Coalition emerged to lead the state into a new era: Senator Ron Johnson, representing the trumpist case, and Senator Tammy Baldwin, a defender of the bidenist ideals. The votes have been counted. Who won?"
 wisconsin.23.a:0 "§RThe Republican, Ron Johnson§!"
 wisconsin.23.b:0 "§BThe Democrat, Tammy Baldwin§!"

 #event 24: elections - trump interferes
 wisconsin.24.t:0 ""Democratic" Elections"
 wisconsin.24.d:0 "We were supposed to hold free and fair elections. However, with Trump’s growing influence already entrenched in our state, the process was anything but democratic. Amid allegations and irregularities, Ron Johnson emerged as the “elected” leader. Whether by popular support or political pressure, the result is clear."
 wisconsin.24.a:0 "Yay. Democracy..."

It is now our duty to consider the political, diplomatic, and military solutions necessary to reforge our state."

 KMT_ultimatum_to_milley_desc:0 "The troops led by Mark Milley crossed the Great Lakes in order to create a new front against the Loyalists, trying lo link up with the NPA. Having this failed, they ended stranded in northern Minnesota and in the northwestern part of our State. If we want to defeat the GLAR we must have all possible resources to do so. Now we should take advantage of the war in Minnesota and demand our rightfull land!"
 KMT_focus_on_what_we_have:0 "Focus on What We Have"
 KMT_focus_on_what_we_have_desc:0 "Even though we could have taken advantage of the situation in Minnesota, it is better for us to focus on the true goal: defeating the GLAR. Perhaps after we defeat them we can look back on what is rightfully ours."
 KMT_prepare_for_the_inevitable:0 "Prepare for the Inevitable"
 KMT_prepare_for_the_inevitable_desc:0 "So far, our sole reason to exist is to fight the disorder that the Libetarian Party of the Great Lakes instilled in, not just our State, but the Great Lakes region.

 KMT_what_to_do_with_the_militant_militia:0 "The Militant Militia Dilema"
 KMT_what_to_do_with_the_militant_militia_desc:0 "We stand in the midst of a dilemma: part of our fight against [GLA.GetName] depends on the Revived Weather Underground Organization. While undeniably useful, they can achieve little without official support. Yet offering that support means potentially empowering a radical Marxist group. The path forward is uncertain, and the risks on both sides are clear."
 KMT_the_forest_division:0 "The Forest Division"
 KMT_the_forest_division_desc:0 "Surrounded by dense forests, our military must adapt to the terrain that defines our homeland.

 KMT_fortification_efforts:0 "Fortify the Border"
 KMT_fortification_efforts_desc:0 "Having a secure and fortified border is the first step in ensuring the [GLA.GetName]'s armies don't just walk right in.

 KMT_the_fight_for_order:0 "The Fight for Order"
 KMT_the_fight_for_order_desc:0 "What are we fighting for? Not for America, at least, not yet. Right now, our struggle is against those who poison our land with chaos, degeneracy, and anarchism.

 KMT_assessing_our_future:0 "Assessing Our Future"
 KMT_assessing_our_future_desc:0 "With the war behind us, a sobering question arises: what now? The alliance forged in desperation must now find purpose in peace.

 KMT_disband_the_trouble_makers_desc:0 "The Weather Underground Militia played a key role in the war against the [GLA.GetName], and their contributions cannot be denied.

Our final decision is to disarm the militia and bring their members under control."
 KMT_integrate_the_militia:0 "Deradicalization from Within"
 KMT_integrate_the_militia_desc:0 "The Weathermen played a key role in our recent victory, but their radicalism remains a serious threat. Instead of direct confrontation, we will pursue a subtler tactic: entryism. By embedding loyal elements within their ranks, we hope to steer them away from extremism and turn them into a force that serves us. It's a risky move, but one that might defuse the danger without provoking open conflict."

 KMT_logistical_reconfiguration_desc:0 "Improving the logistical network around Fort McCoy will strengthen our ability to supply and maneuver forces, giving us a vital edge in the struggles to come. A well-fed, well-equipped army is one that wins wars."
 KMT_transportation_effort:0 "Transportation Efforts"
 KMT_transportation_effort_desc:0 "Our supply lines are the veins of our war effort. By investing in roads, rails, and transport hubs, we can ensure that men, machines, and materials reach the front swiftly and reliably. Logistics may not win glory, but they do win wars."
 KMT_resource_effort:0 "Scraping the Earth"
 KMT_resource_effort_desc:0 "We were not blessed with vast oil fields or rich veins of iron. War, however, does not wait for fortune. If we are to stand a chance, we must scour every inch of our territory for usable materials: sand pits, gravel quarries, forgotten mines, ... anything that can be turned into bullets, steel or war material. No resource, however minor, shall go to waste."
