 #Area 51 Schizo-State
 alien.1.t:0 "Area 51 Petitions For Our Protection"
 alien.1.d:0 "The secretive blacksite of Area 51 broke radio silence with the outside world today in a shocking request to join our faction. They are engaging in... unsettling research, but their findings may be just what we need to reunite America."
 alien.1.a:0 "A Deal With The Devil"
 alien.1.b:0 "Reject Outright."
 alien.2.t:0 "The Microwave Experiment"
 alien.2.d:0 "With our initiative to push the boundaries of scientific experiment, something rather outstanding has landed on [AFO.GetLeader]'s desk. An experiment utilising microwaves on a mass scale. [AFO.GetLeader] didn't really understand the finer details of it- he was a military man, not a boffin. Nevertheless, if he understood correctly, if the hypothesis was proven right in this experiment, Area 51 would be in control of a superweapon hitherto undreamt of, and the pacification of America would be swift.\n\nThere were some details written by some of the skeptical scientists warning of 'disaster' and 'risk' and what-not but... with the whole country on fire, what's a bit of risk to save the world?"
 alien.2.a:0 "Experiment: Approved!"
 alien.3.t:0 "Skeptics protest the Microwave Experiment!"
 alien.3.d:0 "As expected, many of the more skeptical scientists have expressed outrage over the approval of the Microwave Experiment, which has now progressed to the point of being officially named 'Operation Rumbling Thunder'. However, their protests fall on deaf ears. We are in charge, not them. Honestly... what's the worst that could happen?"
 alien.3.a:0 "Continue preparations of Operation Rumbling Thunder."
 alien.4.t:0 "Operation Rumbling Thunder Preparations Complete"
 alien.4.d:0 "The preparations for Operation Rumbling Thunder have been complete. Microwave devices have been constructed underneath the Area 51 base, and smaller variants have been strategically placed elsewhere within our territory. With the skeptics silent, and the military eagerly awaiting results, it's nearly time to turn them on."
 alien.4.a:0 "Ooh, I'm positively giddy with excitement!"
 alien.5.t:0 "Operation Rumbling Thunder"
 alien.5.d:0 "With all preparations done, and everyone positioned in the correct place, it is finally time for Operation Rumbling Thunder to be launched. The final flick of the switch is up to [AFO.GetLeader]. He breathes in. He thinks about America. The destruction... the ruin... the devasation. It all ends here.\n\n\nIt all ends, now."
 alien.5.a:0 "He Flicks the Switch."
 alien.6.t:0 "The Disaster."
 alien.6.d:0 "It's gone bad... it's gone so so..... it's gone so bad.... The skeptics were right... I... I just... Apparently.... appparently the microwaves they fried our brains... they... everyone is screaming... I'm screaming too... I'm screaming but I have no mouth... How...\n\n§RHOW COULD THIS HAPPEN§!\n\n§RIT WAS MEANT TO SAVE US....§!\n\n§RWHAT IS THAT. SOMETHING IS§! §GCOMING OUT THE GROUND. BLACK FIGURES.

 alien.7.t:0 "Bizarre Microwave Readings from Area 51"
 alien.7.d:0 "Scientists from across the world have reported with great worry today strange readings emminating from Area 51 in the Nevada desert. The Blacksite, known for its secrecy, seems to have continued experiments throughout the Civil War. However, with Microwave readings on this level, many fear that something disastrous has taken place. Scout drones are still being shot down and satellite imagery doesn't show anything outstanding."
 alien.7.a:0 "What have they done?"
 alien.7.b:0 "§RTHE DRUMS THE DRUMS THE BEATING OF THE DRUMS§!"
 alien.8.t:0 "Hyperborea is Declared"
 alien.8.d:0 "A Few months after strange readings came out of Area 51, the Blacksite broke radio silence in a... shocking announcement to the world, today. An insane looking Matthew Higer, now referring to himself as "[AFO.GetLeader]" addressed the cameras declaring that the 'Age of Man' was over and that 'Hyperboreans' will now come to dominate this world."
 alien.8.a:0 "What on Earth he is talking about?"
 alien.8.b:0 "They have no idea what's coming." 
 alien.9.t:0 "A Curious Theory"
 alien.9.d:0 "An ambitious, young researcher by the name of Clay has approached the science division with the idea of the creation of an experimental project that could revolutionize warfare. The details are classified, but initial data is promising… and dangerous. With General Higers greenlight on early research and trials, Clay has asked to head this project and requested his own team."
 alien.9.a:0 "He has our approval"
 alien.9.b:0 "A senior should lead" 
 alien.10.t:0 "Trials"
 alien.10.d:0 "Early testing trials are slow, though we are getting some fascinating results. Clay as well as a faction of the science division have voiced their disdain with the speed at which the project is progressing and demand that trials be sped up. With the Mormon War being fought on our doorstep, it would be paramount that we complete our research and send it up to General Higer for full approval as who knows what could happen after our neighbors war ends."
 alien.10.a:0 "Proceed with caution"
 alien.10.b:0 "Speed up the trials" 
 alien.11.t:0 "Trials"
 alien.11.d:0 "Early testing reveals unpredictable and volatile results. Some scientists have expressed concern about continuing without stricter testing oversight."
 alien.11.a:0 "Science slows for no one"
 alien.12.t:0 "Divided"
 alien.12.d:0 "The scientific division is now divided. One faction argues to destroy the project before it goes too far while the other insists they’re close to a breakthrough."
 alien.12.a:0 "Burn the files."
 alien.13.t:0 "Division"
 alien.13.d:0 "The scientific division is now divided. One faction argues to destroy the project before it goes too far while the other insists they’re close to a breakthrough."
