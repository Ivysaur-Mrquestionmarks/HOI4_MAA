 TEX_lone_star_desc:0 "Thanks to the machinations of Greg Abbott, Texas has been pretty much untouched from the Civil War. By pragmatically declaring neutrality while sticking to his values and making sure not to alienate the Republicans, he leads this Lone Star, along with other states into the future. Unfortunately, neutrality has consequences. The terrorists in the west and rebels to in the north are only fueled by our inability to join a side. We must unite a Texan state before it falls apart..."
 TEX_the_election_debate:0 "The Election Debate"
 TEX_the_election_debate_desc:0 "With independence secured for the foreseeable future, there are many now calling for elections to form a legitimate government. However, there are some in our government that argue for delayed elections due to the safety concerns posed by the New Mexican terrorists and Oklahoman rebels. They claim that the efforts and resources allocated for the election would be diverted from dealing with insurgents, and instead advocate for a more radical or authoritarian government."
 TEX_different_direction:0 "Delay the Elections"
 TEX_different_direction_desc:0 "The problem of the New Mexican terrorists in the west and the Oklahoman insurgents to the north have caused us many logistical nightmares. We are unable to hold elections until these problems are dealt with. This may end up forcing us to rely on radicalism, but radical times call for radical measures"
 TEX_monarchist_party_usa:0 "Monarchist Party USA"
 TEX_monarchist_party_usa_desc:0 "A monarchy? In these Dis-United States? It sounds outlandish but.... right now, outlandish is what we need. Perhaps it may be the key to uniting a divided Texas."
 TEX_monarchist_proposal:0 "The Monarchist Proposal"
 TEX_monarchist_proposal_desc:0 "In order to untie our population, we have decided to install a monarch as the head of state. We hope this will quiet down the rebels and create a more secure and safe Texas."
 TEX_embrace_texan_monarchism:0 "Embrace Texan Monarchism"
 TEX_embrace_texan_monarchism_desc:0 "Great news for the Monarchist Party! Greg Abbott himself has become convinced of their merits, and is openly communicating with them! This signals a great future for the party."
 TEX_secure_papal_crown:0 "Pro-Monarchist Rallies"
 TEX_secure_papal_crown_desc:0 "Monarchism hasn't been that popular in America since the revolution in 1776. We must change that, as nearly two and a half centuries later, the situation is much different. By organizing rallies, we can convince the people of the benefits of monarchism and the prosperity we will have!"

 TEX_crack_down_on_insurgents_desc:0 "To keep our citizens safe, we must crack down on insurgents. These terrorist and rebel scum will not harm any more Texans!"
 TEX_invite_radicals:0 "Use Radicals"
 TEX_invite_radicals_desc:0 "Partnering with radicals may be risky, but the pros outweigh the cons. The insurgents we're fighting are surprisingly well at combating our military techniques, and so we need new tactics. Radical groups offer just the solution to our predicament. Even if we may not see eye to eye on everything, we do agree that New Mexico and Oklahoma are rightfully ours."
 TEX_spread_them_among_rebels:0 "Displace Insurgents with Radicals"
 TEX_spread_them_among_rebels_desc:0 "We have begun the process of moving radical groups into contested regions. Several of these radical militias have already engaged with rebels in the region, and since they are being supplied with our superior weaponry the insurgents have been pushed back. They are losing this war, and they're beginning to realize it."
 TEX_work_with_tnm:0 "Work with the Texan National Movement"
 TEX_work_with_tnm_desc:0 "Daniel Miller and his Texan National Movement have, on occasion, caused us problems. However, ninety percent of the time he has been an invaluable asset loyal to the Republic of Texas. He will surely be willing to aid us in our war against New Mexican and Oklahoman rebels."
 TEX_hand_minor_military_control_to_tnm:0 "Nationalism for Unity"
 TEX_hand_minor_military_control_to_tnm_desc:0 "Most liberals act like nationalism is the worst thing that can possibly affect a country, but Abbot disagrees. Nationalism is a uniting force, bringing the people of one nation together against their rivals. It can also be used as a weapon, something Daniel Miller knows well. We will bring Texan nationalism to New Mexico and Oklahoma, cutting off the rebels supply of manpower."
 TEX_greater_concessions:0 "Concede to Unions"
 TEX_greater_concessions_desc:0 "Unions and Texas have not always gone hand-in-hand. In fact, even today there's still an ongoing feud. But the Unions want the same thing as Greg Abbot, safety and prosperity for the Texan people. The rebels in New Mexico and Oklahoma are making this challenging, so perhaps we can make a few concessions for Union support."
 TEX_finish_the_western_and_northern_rebels:0 "Finish Off the Rebels"
 TEX_finish_the_western_and_northern_rebels_desc:0 "Throughout New Mexico and Oklahoma, the rebels are on the run. Thanks to Miller, and several radical groups, the insurgents are being surrounded on all sides. It's time to eradicate them once and for all, and bring stability back to our nation."
 TEX_victory:0 "End the State of Emergency"
 TEX_victory_desc:0 "With the rebels gone, the state of emergency doesn't really have a reason to exist anymore. The people are getting fed up, which is something no one wants. Greg Abbot has declared that the state of emergency will end within the next week, and there will finally be a return to normalcy within our nation. Thank you, Governor Abbot!"
 TEX_one_problem_leads_to_another:0 "An Equal and Opposite Reaction"
 TEX_one_problem_leads_to_another_desc:0 "A wise man once said every action has an equal and opposite reaction, and that is still true. Abbott has made a serious mistake. The rebels may be gone, but in their place is a strongly empowered Texan National Movement and weaponized Unions. Abbott knows now, there will be no return to normalcy for Texas in the foreseeable future."
 TEX_radical_front_merges:0 "Unite the Left"
 TEX_radical_front_merges_desc:0 "While on paper Miller might be the safer option, Abbott knows that the Unions have the support of the Texan people. In the event of a civil war, they would likely come out on top. Perhaps if Abbott works with the Unions, he'll gain more support from the people and stop any whispers of rebellion."
 TEX_cornel_west_man_of_the_people:0 "Man of the People"
 TEX_cornel_west_man_of_the_people_desc:0 "Y'know, back in my day us working class had it rough. Y'know who changed that? Governor Greg Abbott! That man really does have the people's best interests in mind, he has truly made Texas a better place! I know who I'll be voting for in the next elections!"
 TEX_left_wing_populism:0 "Left-Wing Populism"
 TEX_left_wing_populism_desc:0 "Who ever said the left can't be populist? We don't need to rally the people against any external threats when there are corporations harming your average Texan here at home! Maybe Abbott doesn't exactly agree with this rhetoric, but who cares! It's what the people want!"
 TEX_TNM_Organizes:0 "Organize the Texas National Movement"
 TEX_TNM_Organizes_desc:0 "Texans don't like Unions, at least Abbott doesn't like them. The Texan National Movement is much more reliable than the left, Abbott knows what they want. The Unions are a wild card, challenging to control for too long. Therefore it is of the utmost importance that we organize the Texan National Movement into a force capable of fighting them."
 TEX_Miller_man_of_texas:0 "Miller of the Fatherland"
 TEX_Miller_man_of_texas_desc:0 "What does Miller love more than anything? Texas! Many would call him Texas' most loyal son. The problem with the Unions is that, while they may claim to support the Texan people, they don't love the idea of Texas like Miller does. This is why he is such a valuable asset to us; he shares our dream of a greater Texas."
 TEX_organize_marches:0 "Organize Marches"
 TEX_organize_marches_desc:0 "The Texas National Movement may be preferred among the upper echelons of the Republic of Texas, but it has yet to find much support among the regular people. We'll need to change this if we want to disempower the Unions. The simplest way to do this is by holding marches and rallies across the nation. The Texas National Movement, a better future for all Texans!"
 TEX_a_peaceful_approach:0 "A Peaceful Approach"
 TEX_a_peaceful_approach_desc:0 "In the end, we're all Texans. Both the Texan National Movement and the Unions care about the people of our Republic, do we really need to fight? Perhaps Abbott can find some middle ground and bring the people together, and maybe garner some support while he's at it?"
 TEX_anti_abbott_strikes:0 "Anti-Abbott Strikes"
 TEX_anti_abbott_strikes_desc:0 "Well, of course it was going to come to this. Abbott's peaceful approach was too little too late. The Republic of Texas is already so divided, there's nothing the Governor can do. Strikes are enveloping the nation, all with the goal of forcing Abbott's resignation. All he can do now is sit back and watch. He tried, he really did."
 TEX_march_on_the_capital:0 "March on the Capital"
 TEX_march_on_the_capital_desc:0 "Greg Abbott has failed Texas. He has allowed the internal division to grow to the extent of the rest of the former United States of America. Texas is supposed to be a beacon of peace and stability in a nation torn apart, but we aren't anymore. No longer! We will march on the Capital and oust Abbott, bringing stability back to our nation!"
 TEX_act_quick:0 "Act Quick"
 TEX_act_quick_desc:0 "While our coup may have been successful, there will surely be a counter coup sooner than later. We are in a race against time to consolidate power and ensure our dreams for Texas come true. They say time always wins, but our dreams are faster."
 TEX_seize_legislative_control:0 "Seize Legislative Control"
 TEX_seize_legislative_control_desc:0 "While taking complete control of the government won't exactly be popular among the people, it's of the utmost importance we maintain our control. If the government is completely loyal to us, we can pass whatever bills and laws we deem necessary."
 TEX_ensure_lower_rank_loyalty:0 "Ensure Military Loyalty"
 TEX_ensure_lower_rank_loyalty_desc:0 "The Texan Armed Forces are bound to be upset with our coup, and that's a problem. If the military chooses Abbott's side, we'll have no way to truly defend our legitimacy. Replacing officers with those loyal to us is only one piece of the puzzle, we must win over the common soldier too. We can promise increased benefits they would never see under Abbott, and even if we can't back these claims, well we'll cross that bridge when we come to it."
 TEX_seize_judiciary_control:0 "Seize Judicial Control"
 TEX_seize_judiciary_control_desc:0 "We can't have the courts calling our government ‘illegitimate' and ‘unconstitutional' so it's time to seize control. Of course this is only temporary, once we have judges loyal to our government and our new laws, we won't have a need for direct control anymore. I love democracy, don't you?"
 TEX_replace_police_officers:0 "Replace Police Officers"
 TEX_replace_police_officers_desc:0 "While the police might seem a bit too lowly to replace, even they have influence in some places. While many of them are happy as long as they get to stop criminals, there are those who are extremely loyal to Abbott. These ones are the problems, and we must weed them out and remove them. Soon there will be no trace of Abbott left, and Texas will be able to truly flourish."
 TEX_seize_remaining_executive_control:0 "Purge the Executive"
 TEX_seize_remaining_executive_control_desc:0 "There are still those loyal to Abbott within our current government, and we need to get rid of them. Purges are messy, but it's a price we must pay to ensure a brighter future for Texas."
 TEX_purge_military_high_command:0 "Purge the Officers"
 TEX_purge_military_high_command_desc:0 "No counter coup is complete without a military to back them, and the Texan Armed Forces are still mostly pro-Abbott. We must quickly remove their officers and replace them with our own. While this may damage our military's expertise, it's worth it to ensure we stay in power."
 TEX_our_rule_secured:0 "Our Rule Secured"
 TEX_our_rule_secured_desc:0 "The early days of our administration were rocked with instability and risk of collapse, but that's no longer the case. Abbott isn't a threat anymore, and our government is seen as legitimate by every faction that could reasonably back a counter coup. With our rule secured, we can finally set out to fix the problems the old Governor caused."

 TEX_Radicalism:0 "Popular Front"
 TEX_Radicalism_desc:0 "Greg Abbott is a man of two faces. While he may claim to support the Texan people, he also actively ignores their cries for help. He empowers groups like the Texan National Movement, while claiming it's to help the people. The people need food, water, and a roof over their heads. Abbott cannot be allowed to rule any longer!"
 TEX_rise_of_populism:0 "Rise of Populism"
 TEX_rise_of_populism_desc:0 "No longer will our beautiful Texas be enslaved by oil barons and corrupt politicians. From today onwards Texas will be a nation ruled by the people, with some assistance from Cornel West of course. Chairman West, not to be confused with Kanye West, now faces an important decision. How will our nation move into the future?"
 TEX_benevolent_dictator:0 "Benevolent Dictator"
 TEX_benevolent_dictator_desc:0 "Cornel West has made his decision. While Texas is a nation of the people, it needs a government capable of protecting those people. And so the time has come for Chairman West to truly embrace his title, and to ensure the people of Texas have a protective shield above them."
 TEX_expand_executive_power:0 "Expand Executive Power"
 TEX_expand_executive_power_desc:0 "Chairman West cannot govern Texas alone, and the coup of Greg Abbott crippled the nation's already weak executive branch. If the reformed Texan Republic is to outlive West, he must ensure it has a strong government capable of leading the people after his death. However, more importantly, he must ensure the new government is cleansed of the filth that is corruption."
 TEX_crack_down_on_republicans:0 "Fuck Over Republicans"
 TEX_crack_down_on_republicans_desc:0 "While it may be true that not all Republicans are bad, their ideology extremely contradicts our own. When we look towards a brighter future, we see one without Republicans. Their party has been in shambles since the ousting of Abbott, and it's time to finish them off."
 TEX_exile_trumpists:0 "Exile Trumpists"
 TEX_exile_trumpists_desc:0 "If Republicans were bad, Trumpists are one thousand times worse. They are the reason America was brought to its knees, and we must ensure the same does not happen to our Texas. Death is too good for them, we will exile them from our country, never to return."
 TEX_cleanse_judiciary:0 "Cleanse the Judiciary"
 TEX_cleanse_judiciary_desc:0 "The most corrupt part of Texas under Greg Abbott, and potentially the old United States as a whole, was the judicial branch. How ironic is it that the people in charge of maintaining the law were instead the ones breaking it? Chairman West must ensure the judicial branch of the new government cannot be corrupted, and that the interests of the people always weigh heavier than their own."
 TEX_work_with_bernie:0 "Work With Bernie" 
 TEX_work_with_bernie_desc:0 "Comrade Sanders was among the first to champion socialism within the United States. Within California he has erected a mighty People's Republic of America, and while his relationship with China may sour some's opinion of him, he is still a fighter for the people. Working with him will surely be invaluable."
 TEX_welcome_people_in_need:0 "Welcome People in Need"
 TEX_welcome_people_in_need_desc:0 "The former USA is full of people in need, and some have immigrated here. We welcome them! Our southern neighbor has been plagued with cartel violence for years, and now civil war. This has led many to immigrate here. We welcome them!

 TEX_welcome_bernie_exiles_desc:0 "It is a great shame that the People's Republic of America has fallen, but the dream of socialism still lives on here. Many from the PRA have braved the anarchy out west to reach here, including Comrade Sanders himself. Chairman West was overjoyed to finally meet him in person, and preparations for something big have begun."
 TEX_the_second_PRA:0 "The Second Peoples Republic"
 TEX_the_second_PRA_desc:0 "While California may have been lost, the least we can do is host an official government-in-exile here in Texas.

 TEX_end_the_oil_barons_desc:0 "For too long the lifeblood of Texas, oil, has been owned by a greedy few. Now, they are gone, but their vast fortunes remain. With these fortunes we can fund numerous initiatives for the betterment of the people's livelihoods!"
 TEX_promote_domestic_industry:0 "Protectionism"
 TEX_promote_domestic_industry_desc:0 "Before the Second American Civil War, the economy of the USA was extremely reliant on other countries. If we want our nation to survive, we must set up our economy to rely on no one but ourselves."

 TEX_fair_compensation_desc:0 "Too many workers have suffered injuries, or even perished, doing dangerous jobs. These workers and their families usually got very little compensation unless they brought the incident to court.

 TEX_enshrine_workers_rights:0 "Enshrine Workers Rights"
 TEX_enshrine_workers_rights_desc:0 "If Chairman West had to pick one thing about the Texas he had built to outlive him, it would be workers’ rights. We must forge the rights of workers into the very essence of our nation, to ensure they last as long as Texans draw breath!"
 TEX_Christian_Socialism:0 "Christian Socialism"
 TEX_Christian_Socialism_desc:0 "Christianity has always been prominent in the south and Texas, and Christians were bound to be against us. While their religion doesn't have a place in government, we have no intent of removing them and would much rather work side by side."
 TEX_work_with_churches:0 "Work with Churches"
 TEX_work_with_churches_desc:0 "Churches are a place for people to come together, and so is socialism. Socialism advocates for empowering the people and uplifting those in poverty. Churches run charities aimed at feeding the poor and helping rehabilitate people. We're not so different, and can surely work together to better Texas."
 TEX_reject_marxism:0 "Reject Marxism"
 TEX_reject_marxism_desc:0 "Karl Marx once called religion the opium of the people. We do not agree with Marx, or any of the atheist Marxist socialist countries of the past. Religion is a wonderful thing, and while it shouldn't be forced on anyone, neither should the opposite."
 TEX_jesus_was_a_socialist:0 "Jesus was a Leftist"
 TEX_jesus_was_a_socialist_desc:0 "There is a saying that if Jesus ran for president he wouldn't win. Mainly because of the simple fact that Jesus was a leftist. He supported the people, and felt that everyone should be treated equally. Love your fellow man is not the kind of thing an oil baron or a politician would say, but Jesus said it. We know that Jesus would approve of our vision for Texas."
 TEX_army_of_the_people:0 "Army of the People"

 TEX_everyone_deserves_liberty_desc:0 "Cornel West has made his decision. Texas has always loved freedom, and therefore a large government would be going against the will of the people.

 TEX_promote_small_businesses_desc:0 "What's more American than small business? Everyone loves the old Ma and Pa diner in their neighborhood, or the ancient bookstore that's been there as long as their grandfather can remember. Big corporations do nothing but damage small businesses. Cornel West has decided to start a campaign to bring business back to the people."
 TEX_empower_labor_unions:0 "Transition to Syndicalism"
 TEX_empower_labor_unions_desc:0 "Syndicalism is a bit of a strange ideology, in a way it's truly as socialist as you can get without anarchism. West has seen the need for a syndicalist Texas, something many Texans have desired without exactly realizing it. The transition may be a rocky one, but it will be well worth it."
 TEX_freedom_of_speech:0 "Freedom of Speech"
 TEX_freedom_of_speech_desc:0 "It is all too common for socialist states to begin suppressing the freedom of speech Americans and Texans hold so dear. Our state would be nothing without the freedom of speech, and we would do good to remember that. The American constitution may have been flawed, but they certainly did not mess up the First Amendment."
 TEX_unironic_syndicalism:0 "Unironic Syndicalism Achieved"
 TEX_unironic_syndicalism_desc:0 "After much work, Syndicalism has been achieved. Unironically. Cornel West has successfully established the first real syndicalist nation, and things are going smoothly. Empowering the different syndicates and eradicating the rest of the government was tough, but it has been done."
 TEX_freedom_of_press:0 "Freedom of Press and Demonstration"
 TEX_freedom_of_press_desc:0 "Just like freedom of speech, the freedom of the press and right to protest are two more fundamental pillars of our democracy. Without them we become no better than the North Koreans, and may cause us to lose respect among potential allies. That is why the whole of the First Amendment must be protected."
 TEX_protect_fifth_ammendment_rights:0 "Protect the Fifth Amendment"
 TEX_protect_fifth_ammendment_rights_desc:0 "If we are to be a truly just nation, we must protect and enforce the Fifth Amendment. This is another example of the positive aspects of the American Constitution that are worth protecting.

 TEX_end_penal_slavery:0 "End Penal Slavery"
 TEX_end_penal_slavery_desc:0 "While slavery may have technically been abolished nearly two hundred years ago, it still exists to this day.

 TEX_by_the_people:0 "By the People.."
 TEX_by_the_people_desc:0 "While Cornel West may have helped build the new Texas, it was truly built by the people. None of this would be possible without their blood, sweat, and tears. Many of them have lost loved ones as a result of the Second American Civil War, but they can rest easy knowing the Texas they have built will endure."
 TEX_for_the_people:0 "...For the People"
 TEX_for_the_people_desc:0 "The people did not build the new Texas for oil tycoons, or Donald Trump, or Joe Biden, they built it for themselves.

 TEX_national_front_desc:0 "The Texan National Movement has seen through Abbott's lies. While he may claim to believe in a free independent Texas, all he's done so far is divide the people. A house divided against itself cannot stand! Daniel Miller will make a much better leader than Greg Abbott, and it's time to put him in charge."
 TEX_TNM:0 "Nationalist Authority"
 TEX_TNM_desc:0 "Greg Abbott's failures have led to a loss of faith in the Texan nation, something that cannot last. It's time for Daniel Miller and the Texan National Movement to bring back a true Texan identity, and show why Texas is the greatest nation to form from the remnants of the USA."

 TEX_the_Miller_gov_desc:0 "Daniel Miller has assumed full control of the government to ensure a smooth transition from Abbott to the new regime.

Soon the Republic of Texas will have a strong government backing Miller, and protecting all Texans!"
 TEX_national_liberalism:0 "National Liberalism"
 TEX_national_liberalism_desc:0 "Many people will tell you nationalism and liberalism cannot coexist, this simply isn’t true! In a way, liberalism is a form of nationalism. Liberalism is usually about supporting the people, and nationalism is about recognizing our people as better than others. Anyone who tells you they can’t work together is out of their mind!"
 TEX_equality_for_all_TEXANS:0 "Equality, Only for Texans"
 TEX_equality_for_all_TEXANS_desc:0 "All Texans are created equal, equally better than others. Our nation is full of those who aren’t exactly Texans, and they should know their place. The term Texan can be used as an umbrella to refer to many groups of people, but there are some groups it just doesn’t refer to. Those ones are the lessers. Texas for Texans!"
 TEX_Texan_welfare:0 "Texan Welfare"

 TEX_creation_of_paramilitaries:0 "The Paramilitary Wing of the TNM"
 TEX_creation_of_paramilitaries_desc:0 "Back when the Texas National Movement was just beginning, a decision was made for it to form a paramilitary group.

Now, the time has come to reform them into Miller’s personal armed forces, loyal to no one but him."
 TEX_promote_individualism_and_independence:0 "Individualism and Independence"
 TEX_promote_individualism_and_independence_desc:0 "There are still those in our nation who identify as American thanks to decades of oppression from Washington.

 TEX_close_the_borders:0 "Close the Borders"
 TEX_close_the_borders_desc:0 "The time has come to close the border, not just with Mexico, but with everyone.

 TEX_texanize_rio_grande:0 "Texanize the Rio Grande"
 TEX_texanize_rio_grande_desc:0 "Our little venture into the Rio Grande has turned it into true Texan territory. While the people there may not be too happy with their current situation, it’s better than what’s going on in the rest of Mexico. Daniel Miller has approved a plan to spread Texan culture south of the Rio, to make sure all the people there happily accept Texas as their homeland."
 TEX_texan_primacy:0 "Texas First!"
 TEX_texan_primacy_desc:0 "Texas stands tall among the many successor and splinter states of North America. Our great nation has found the peace and stability so many others search for. Our food, money, and resources will not be given away for free. They will be given to Texas, and Texas first!"
 TEX_embrace_nationalism:0 "Replace Patriotism with Nationalism"
 TEX_embrace_nationalism_desc:0 "There’s a saying that patriotism is loving your country for what it does, and nationalism is loving your country no matter what it does. Damn straight! Everyone should love their country not matter what, especially when their country is Texas!"

 TEX_control_the_oil_barons_desc:0 "Our greatest resource is oil, and we have lots of it. However vast quantities of it are controlled by a select few, the oil barons. While we cannot simply take their resources, we can pull some strings and ensure they are loyal to us and us alone."
 TEX_push_our_limits:0 "Push Our Limits"

 TEX_oil_for_independence_and_territories:0 "Deal with Trump"
 TEX_oil_for_independence_and_territories_desc:0 "On much of our northern flank is the loyalist USA, run by Donald Trump. While Miller and Trump may not see eye-to-eye on everything, it’s in both’s best interests to come to an agreement. In exchange for recognizing Texan independence and the rest of Oklahoma, Texas will recognize Trump as the legitimate successor to the USA. After all, why does it matter who’s in charge of America? We aren’t part of it anymore!"
 TEX_the_Texan_industry:0 "The TEXAN Industry"
 TEX_the_Texan_industry_desc:0 "Some people will say that California or the Rust Belt has greater industry than Texas, not true!

 TEX_expand_texan_oil_production:0 "Expand Production of Our Greatest Commodity"

 TEX_promote_texanism:0 "Texanism"
 TEX_promote_texanism_desc:0 "Texas, for a long time, was part of the USA. This is true. But within the USA we had our own distinct culture and ideals, things that we wish to bring back in our new nation. What we will not bring back are the ideals of America, as we are no longer their puppet."
 TEX_distance_from_americanism:0 "...Over Americanism"
 TEX_distance_from_americanism_desc:0 "If we truly want Texan ideals to flourish, we can’t have them exist alongside old American ones. White Miller has done a good job replacing them, there are still some that need to be phased out. Americanism is so early 2000s!"

 TEX_New_Treaty_of_Tordesillas_desc:0 "Nearly six hundred years ago a treaty was signed between Spain and Portugal splitting up the world.

 TEX_demand_UN_assistance_desc:0 "Surely the United Nations would be happy to help with the humanitarian crisis happening to our east, right? Even if we aren’t a completely recognized member, they should still at the very least reply to our demands. Isn’t it their job to help people in need?"
 TEX_on_our_own:0 "On Our Own"
 TEX_on_our_own_desc:0 "After the UN has declined our plea for aid. it has become apparent that we are the only ones who can help the people of the Deep South. While Abbott doesn’t have a strong plan for our next steps, it seems like direct intervention is becoming more likely."
 TEX_denounce_radical_elements:0 "Denounce Radicals"
 TEX_denounce_radical_elements_desc:0 "Denouncing the radicals to our East is somewhat redundant, given that nearly every major faction is a radical group. Regardless, our criticism will surely be enough to at least partially lower their morale."
 TEX_invade_the_klan:0 "Invade the Klan"
 TEX_invade_the_klan_desc:0 "Almost everyone within Texas, and the world, agreed that the Klan is pretty bad. If we are to ensure that we don’t have a hostile nation to our east once the Confederacy is reunited, we must make sure we strike down the Klan.

 TEX_secure_new_orleans:0 "Secure New Orleans"
 TEX_secure_new_orleans_desc:0 "What exactly is going on in New Orleans is confusing, to say the least.

 TEX_minor_positions:0 "Give Minor Positions"
 TEX_minor_positions_desc:0 "While we respect our allies in Dixie, they simply aren’t as good at running Texas as Texans are. As such they will be given less influential, minor roles within the Texan governmental machine. If they complain, they had better do well to remember who’s hosting them."
 TEX_major_positions:0 "Offer Major Positions"
 TEX_major_positions_desc:0 "The officials that were evacuated from Dixie were skilled at running their nation, and would be of much greater service in influential government positions.

In fact, just a few years ago we were no more than an illegitimate nation clinging to a few southern states. Now we’ve spread our wings, but they’ve spread far enough.

He will set a good example for all Texan Kings to follow!"
 TEX_bush_coup:0 "The 3rd Bush Administration"
 TEX_bush_coup_desc:0 "George W. Bush didn’t really intend on coming out of retirement, but it was clear Texas needed him. With that crazy Kaiser now gone, Texas can begin to move forward. With a bit of help from Bush, the nation can be healed!"
 TEX_unban_political_parties:0 "Unban Political Parties"

 TEX_restore_seperation_of_powers:0 "Restore the Separation of Powers"

 TEX_ranchers_desc:0 "Ranchers were some of the first people to settle in Texas, and many owe their roots to them.

 TEX_saints:0 "...and Saints!"
 TEX_saints_desc:0 "Texas is a very religious state, although not to the extent of some more radical groups within the former USA.

 TEX_moderate_climate_regulation:0 "Moderate Climate Regulation..."
 TEX_moderate_climate_regulation_desc:0 "Under the Kaiser oil production was pushed into overdrive, and the environment suffered.

 TEX_negotiate_with_bernie:0 "The Mad Man"
 TEX_negotiate_with_bernie_desc:0 "While the PRA is not recognized by many as legitimate, they are still a strong potential unifier.

 TEX_get_international_recognition_desc:0 "Now that the main successors to the USA have recognized our independence, the time has come to garner international support.

 TEX_a_deal_with_trump_desc:0 "While our nation was in a precarious state, our northern regions and Oklahoma were taken from us by Trump.

 TEX_rescue_jeb:0 "Rescue Jeb"
 TEX_rescue_jeb_desc:0 "Intelligence gathered from Florida shows that Jeb may actually still breathe. King Bush has hastily prepared a covert rescue operation to break Jeb out of his captor’s prison, and return him home to his brother’s open arms!"
 TEX_welcome_moderates:0 "Welcome Moderates"
 TEX_welcome_moderates_desc:0 "Our nation welcomes those from both sides of the aisle, so long as they don’t harbor radical ideas. Moderates who don’t mindlessly hate their rival are paramount for ensuring politics go smoothly, and will help make Texas better!"
 TEX_land_of_moderatism:0 "The Land of Moderatism"
 TEX_land_of_moderatism_desc:0 "No one should feel like voting for a man simply because he’s of their party. If our parties all get along, then Texans will vote for those who they honestly believe to be best for their nation. Texan is not a land of radicalism, but of moderatism!"
 TEX_parliamentary_monarchy:0 "Establish a Parliamentary Monarchy"

 TEX_gop_lib_coalition:0 "GOP-Libertarian Coalition"

 TEX_crush_the_freedom_coalition_desc:0 "When a maximum-security prison is left unchecked, and the prisoners escape, you'd think that they'd spread anarchy and crime in their wake.

 TEX_Finish_The_Cali_Texas_Rivalry:0 "Finish the California-Texas Rivalry"
 TEX_Finish_The_Cali_Texas_Rivalry_desc:0 "California. The ‘Liberal Texas'. We couldn't get rid of them while the Union was still around, but with America in shambles, we can finally keep them out of Texas…by annexing them into Texas."
 TEX_A_Deal_With_Trump:0 "A Deal With Mr. Trump"
 TEX_A_Deal_With_Trump_desc:0 "A large majority of the Texan population supported Trump in previous elections, so not being very aggressive with him is a good idea. He's a businessman at heart, so surely he'd accept a reasonable request for the Western Command Zone. He did write "Art Of The Deal" after all."
 TEX_Invade_Montana:0 "Invade Big Sky Country"
 TEX_Invade_Montana_desc:0 "Despite being one of the least populated states in the Union, strange things have been happening in Montana. From Nazis to Authoritarians, and all other sorts of miscreants, they need to be set straight."

 TEX_March_Into_Cascadia_desc:0 "Cascadia, or more accurately, Washington and Oregon have long been political issues. While they did revolt against and fight the Communists of California, this hardly excuses their past. If we are to secure America, we will need to ensure this once hot-bed of Leftism can never act against us again."
 TEX_Claim_all_of_Cali:0 "Integrate California"
 TEX_Claim_all_of_Cali_desc:0 "Maybe these Californians aren't so bad after all. Most of the population isn't that different from average Texans, and aside from the major cities, they have an almost similar culture. Maybe we aren't so different in the end."

 TEX_Bring_49_and_50_back_into_the_fold_desc:0 "Hawaii and Alaska. While not serious threats since the dissolution of the Pacific fleet's junta, they still represent key pieces of America. The naval experience will also help us prepare for any foreign intervention."

 TEX_Western_Republic_of_America_desc:0 "From the shores of Houston, to the frigid waters of Anchorage, Texan might and values have secured a place across America. But a new possibility is evident. Why should they just be Texan values? Why not American values? Why not a new America?"

 TEX_surrounded_on_all_fronts_desc:0 "Communists, traitors, and populists, and at the center of it, us. If these forces ever come to clash, we'll be at the heart of it. We need to prepare for this eventuality."

 TEX_provide_for_the_border_patrol_desc:0 "While America tears itself apart, the Mexican-American border lays mostly open.

 TEX_Ban_Abortion:0 "Ban Abortion"
 TEX_Ban_Abortion_desc:0 "In Trump’s America, the ideal one, the unchristian practice of abortion has been banned. The idea that anyone could rob a baby of its right to live so early is appalling! We must follow his good example and make sure all Texan babies are protected."
 TEX_Trumpist_Advisors:0 "Trumpist Advisors"
 TEX_Trumpist_Advisors_desc:0 "The USA has some of the best military generals in the world, and with us recently opening cooperation with them we’d like to borrow some. It’s in both Trump and Patrick’s favor that Texas has a strong army, and with competent advisors we’ll make it happen!"
 TEX_Extradite_Democrats_and_RINOs:0 "Extradite Democrats and RINOs"
 TEX_Extradite_Democrats_and_RINOs_desc:0 "Texas has its fair share of traitors, to America and the Republican Party. The democrats wish to turn our nation into a communist hellscape, and the RINOs have betrayed our party! They will be handed over to Trump to be dealt with accordingly."
 TEX_buy_oklahoma:0 "Buy Oklahoma"
 TEX_buy_oklahoma_desc:0 "The rest of Oklahoma is under Trump’s control, and despite his favor of us he won’t give it over for free. However, he’ll surely be willing to hand it over for some of the resources and equipment that Texas has. Soon all of Oklahoma will be ours!"
 TEX_legalize_lobbying:0 "Legalize Lobbying"
 TEX_legalize_lobbying_desc:0 "How can a government be expected to make decisions if companies can’t donate to them?

 TEX_Texan_command_zone_desc:0 "Just like the Western Command Zone, we will become loyal to Trump. While we’re still not directly controlled by him, we will certify our support for him by proclaiming the Texan Command Zone! Soon Texas will be one with the USA once more, under Donald J. Trump!"

 TEX_Texan_claim_dixie_for_trump_desc:0 "Even if the Confederacy may be ideologically similar to us, they can’t be allowed to exist any longer.

 TEX_panhandle_treaty:0 "Panhandle Treaty"
 TEX_panhandle_treaty_desc:0 "Trump’s son, Barron, has carved out his own little fiefdom in Florida. While he may seem a little crazy to some, at least he’s pretty loyal to his father, and so are we. We can easily win over his favor if we give him the Florida panhandle currently under our control."
 TEX_southern_command_center:0 "Southern Command Center"
 TEX_southern_command_center_desc:0 "The name Texan Command Center is no longer fitting as we’ve expanded far beyond Texas.

 TEX_join_the_big_boss:0 "Join the Big Boss"
 TEX_join_the_big_boss_desc:0 "Everything has fallen into place, and the time has come to officially join the USA. While we’ve been a de facto part of it for a while, it’s time to let Trump take full control.

While some may mourn the loss of the dream of Texan independence, many cheer for our official president. Long live Donald J. Trump!"
 TEX_trump_failure:0 "A Great Failure"
 TEX_trump_failure_desc:0 "This is truly a sign of how far humanity has strayed from God. The USA has fallen, and Trump is probably dead.

 TEX_evacuate_industry:0 "Evacuate Industry"
 TEX_evacuate_industry_desc:0 "There are a few areas of the USA we still control with heavy industry, and we cannot allow them to fall into the hands of our enemies.

 TEX_divided_exiles:0 "The Divided Exiles"
 TEX_divided_exiles_desc:0 "Trump touched the hearts and souls of many Americans across the nation, and so now they lie scattered, but not defeated.

 TEX_unite_with_nra:0 "Unite with NRA West Virginia?"
 TEX_unite_with_nra_desc:0 "The National Rifle Association has secured control over West Virginia, and is still loyal to our cause. Similarly to the WCZ, they are well established within Appalachia and also offer close proximity to the Federal Republic of America homeland. Uniting with them will strongly benefit the Trumpist cause!"
 TEX_unite_with_ida:0 "Unite with the Western Command Zone?"
 TEX_unite_with_ida_desc:0 "Donald Trump’s Rocky Mountain military zone still stands, and is the second largest Trumpist stronghold left in America.

 TEX_trumpist_commander_safehaven:0 "Trumpist Safehaven"
 TEX_trumpist_commander_safehaven_desc:0 "Many important military officers who sided with Trump were forced to evacuate when the USA fell, and we must go about retrieving them.

 TEX_not_perma_defeat_desc:0 "The guns fall silent, the artillery stops falling, and the planes no longer fly overhead. The last of our enemies have been destroyed, and peace has come to America. On this day, the sun rises on a new nation. We are still the United States of America, but we are what it was meant to be! Not a land of cancel culture and woke ideology, a land of patriots!

 TEX_Cozy_up_to_Oil_Barons:0 "Cozy up to Oil Barons"
 TEX_Cozy_up_to_Oil_Barons_desc:0 "Trying to control the Oil Barons won’t benefit us in any way, shape, or form. If anything we should be sucking up to them, so that they might feel inclined to give us some gifts. The Barons are as pro-Trump as Patrick, if not more so, and would surely be willing to help us for some incentives."
 TEX_expand_oil_production:0 "Expand Oil Production"
 TEX_expand_oil_production_desc:0 "Trump’s war machine needs a more steady supply of oil, and Texas offers that. Patrick, working with the Barons, has pushed oil production and exports into overdrive. New drilling sites have also been erected to make sure the Big Man gets his black gold."
 TEX_deregulate_the_economy:0 "Deregulate the Economy"
 TEX_deregulate_the_economy_desc:0 "In times of crisis, regulations on the economy do nothing but hurt it. Many of the current regulations were imposed by woke liberals, and are hurting Texas more than helping it. By removing these regulations, the economy will flourish! Who cares about a few dangerous substances?"
 TEX_send_migrants_back:0 "Send the Migrants Back!"
 TEX_send_migrants_back_desc:0 "Too many Texans have lost their jobs to dangerous migrants! Not only that, but migrants are lazy and don’t work and take your houses! Oh yeah, they’re all drug addicts and cartel members too! We’re sending them to Mexico to make sure they don’t endanger anyone else!"
 TEX_end_new_mexican_rebels:0 "End the New Mexican Rebellion"
 TEX_end_new_mexican_rebels_desc:0 "Why are people even rebelling in New Mexico anyways, don’t they know there’s nothing there? The New Mexicans should have learned by now that they are only able to survive because of us! It’s time to put down the crazy ideologues once and for all!"
 TEX_cultural_counter_revolution:0 "A Cultural Counter-Revolution"
 TEX_cultural_counter_revolution_desc:0 "What the woke left calls a cultural revolution is just that, a revolution!

 TEX_ban_LGBTQIA2S_Thinking_desc:0 "There are two genders, and anyone who thinks otherwise should be sent to a mental hospital or re-educated!

 TEX_the_ten_commandments_in_school:0 "Teach the Ten Commandments in Schools"
 TEX_the_ten_commandments_in_school_desc:0 "God gave out Ten Commandments, and yet they aren’t taught in school! Why should someone have to wait until they’re in high school to learn something so important? The Ten Commandments should be read alongside story books as early as kindergarten!"

 TEX_crush_the_texan_trumpists_desc:0 "Trump and his allies are a scourge on the Republican Party, and cannot be allowed to exist within Texas. Since Bush’s takeover they’ve already lost some ground, but it’s time to push them out once and for all!"

 TEX_imprison_cruz_and_abbott_desc:0 "Ted Cruz and Greg Abbott are two people who are instrumentally important to Trump’s influence in Texas.

 TEX_work_with_moderate_dems_desc:0 "To show we truly are not Trumpist Republicans, an offer has been extended across the aisle to collaborate on some legislation. There are those within the Democratic Party who would be willing to work with us, and will help us show unity in these trying times."

 TEX_put_dick_in_dictator_desc:0 "Cheney was a relatively strong VP, being heavily influential in the senate and house, and more importantly, to Bush. It is best that Cheney stay a loyal advisor to Bush’s new regime."
 TEX_a_true_cowboy:0 "A True Cowboy"

 TEX_mop_up_the_remainders_desc:0 "Even with most of the major players eliminated, there are still several other minor warlords left in the former USA. The time has come to mop them up, so we can proudly proclaim that America is ours! Down with the traitors and up with the stars!"
 
 TEX_southern_shield:0 "Assess the Situation"
 TEX_southern_shield_desc:0 "Among the former United States of America are those who may still be friendly to our cause. It would be much more beneficial to us, and to them, if we were to work side by side rather than fight. Perhaps the dream of American unity is not dead."
 TEX_a_sense_of_stability:0 "Lead the Moderates"
 TEX_a_sense_of_stability_desc:0 "Both sides of the aisle have those who do not have outlandish or radical views, they are known as moderates. What exactly a moderate is can be unclear at times, but what they aren’t is crazy. George Bush has worked to bring moderates on both sides together, so that we may prevent the polarization of our country from returning."
 TEX_ally_npa:0 "Ally the NPA"
 TEX_ally_npa_desc:0 "Most of the remaining Moderate Republicans in Trump’s government have split away and formed the NPA. Their nation is weak and unstable, but they’re better than nothing. Bush wishes to work with them, and surely they’ll be open to compromise."
 TEX_ally_mit:0 "Ally Romney"
 TEX_ally_mit_desc:0 "A little over a decade ago many saw Mitt Romney as the most radical Republican, and the fact that he could now be considered moderate shows how much the party has changed. Romney and Bush have enjoyed positive relations in the past, and the man would surely be willing to work together again."
 TEX_ally_cox:0 "Ally Utah Republicans"
 TEX_ally_cox_desc:0 "Utah has always been an interesting case, but in recent decades they’ve become fairly moderately conservative. Many influential Utah republicans were disenfranchised with the election of Trump, and now with the fracturing of America they’ve become even more so. Bush believes they would be willing to ally themselves with us, and there’s no harm in trying."
 TEX_ally_moderate_dems:0 "Ally Moderate Democrats"
 TEX_ally_moderate_dems_desc:0 "Bush knows that the Democrats have plenty of non-radical members that might be open to working with him, and now he just has to meet with them. For the sake of America’s future, they will surely be willing to set aside their differences and work together."
 TEX_ally_arnold:0 "Ally California Republicans"
 TEX_ally_arnold_desc:0 "California has been one of the most liberal states in America for quite some time now, meaning their Republicans are about as far left as they get. Despite this they’re still conservative, and would probably be willing to work with Bush to combat the PRA."
 TEX_kill_populists:0 "End Populist Warlords"
 TEX_kill_populists_desc:0 "The USA has no place for populists, and most Americans know this. Across the continent there are those under the control of populist regimes that yearn to break free, and Bush will help them."
 TEX_kill_autocrats:0 "End Autocratic Warlords"
 TEX_kill_autocrats_desc:0 "America is not a land of kings or dictators, and so autocratic nations have no place here. Bush will lead the charge against these warlords to ensure their ideology cannot spread."
 TEX_kill_anarchists:0 "End Anarchist Warlords"
 TEX_kill_anarchists_desc:0 "America may be the land of the free, but anarchy is a little too free. The people, if allowed to run rampant, will destroy everything. Bush cannot allow these anarchist nations, if they can even be called that, to exist for any longer."
 TEX_george_reunite:0 "Peaceful Reunification"
 TEX_george_reunite_desc:0 "In the heart of every American is respect. Not just for their country, but for their brothers and sisters throughout it. Modern times have tried to tear the American people apart, knock them down and try to stop them from ever getting up again. But George Bush and people on both sides of the aisle know that peace is still an option, America does not have to stay fractured. There will be no great crusade, just a grand party welcoming back our brothers and sisters!"

 #Oil Barons BGB MOMENT
 TEX_red_does_not_stain_the_black_gold:0 "Blood Does Not Stain Black Gold"
 TEX_red_does_not_stain_the_black_gold_desc:0 "This war has torn America, and to a lesser extent Texas, apart. But it is of the utmost importance that one thing does not change. THE OIL MUST FLOW."
 TEX_the_biggest_one_of_all:0 "Fan the Flames..."
 TEX_the_biggest_one_of_all_desc:0 "The revolt against the Oil Barons has brought about an opportunity for old Dick Cheney. The barons need his help to crush the revolution, and he is more than willing to help. There are two things Cheney loves in this world. Oil, and war"
 TEX_hierarchy_like_one_never_before:0 "...That Consume the Black Gold"
 TEX_hierarchy_like_one_never_before_desc:0 "The revolutionaries have been crushed, but Cheney’s power has grown to extremely high levels. The Barons can do nothing but watch as the madman takes control of Texas from them. Fortunately, it seems their guardian angels are watching over them, and Cheney doesn’t seem to intend to remove the Barons. In fact, he’s ordered them to maximize oil production. What could he be planning..."
 TEX_announce_true_intentions_of_iraq:0 "Announce Iraq's True Intentions..."
 TEX_announce_true_intentions_of_iraq_desc:0 "Hey you, yes I’m talking to you. Dick Cheney here, and yeah, you probably saw the focus title. You probably think I’m pretty crazy, alright. But you know who else is crazy? Iraq! They’ve got WMDs you know, we might not have found them twenty years ago, but I’m sure we’ll find them this time. Third time’s the charm, as they say."
 TEX_and_dont_be_sorry:0 "...And Don't Be Sorry About It"
 TEX_and_dont_be_sorry_desc:0 "I’m not going to lie to you, this war won’t be easy. Now, clearly Iraq isn’t on the map, lucky you. All you’ll have to do is reunite America. The third invasion of Iraq will just be inferred to occur once I’m in control of the entirety of North America. Don’t act like you’re surprised, you wouldn’t have chosen this path for a normal playthrough."
 TEX_secret_experiments:0 "Our Secret Experiments"
 TEX_secret_experiments_desc:0 "I’m not going to lie to you, this war won’t be easy. Now, clearly Iraq isn’t on the map, lucky you. All you’ll have to do is reunite America. The third invasion of Iraq will just be inferred to occur once I’m in control of the entirety of North America. Don’t act like you’re surprised, you wouldn’t have chosen this path for a normal playthrough."
 TEX_tighten_the_grip:0 "Tighten Our Grip"
 TEX_tighten_the_grip_desc:0 "Texas is ours now, just you and me. You could stop now, start another game, go eat some dinner. But nope, you’re here helping Old Cheney reunite America. I’ve made sure the leftists and the opposition won’t be a problem anymore, thanks for your help."
 TEX_oil_empire:0 "An Empire of Oil"
 TEX_oil_empire_desc:0 "I’m a pretty big fan of oil, you know? And you clearly are too, or you wouldn’t have chosen this path. Help me get all of the oil in America so we can finally take our Iraq."
 TEX_control_shipping_lanes:0 "Control American Shipping Lanes"
 TEX_control_shipping_lanes_desc:0 "We built the Panama Canal, by that logic it’s ours. So come on, let’s go get it back. And maybe the rest of Central America while we’re at it."
 TEX_bring_liberty_to_south_american_oil:0 "Bring §B Liberty§W  to South American Oil§!"
 TEX_bring_liberty_to_south_american_oil_desc:0 "Now, I know there’s only a bit of South America on the map, but how funny is it that both countries actually have a lot of oil? C’mon, let’s go liberate it."
 TEX_dakota_and_denver_oil:0 "Dakota and Denver's Oil"
 TEX_dakota_and_denver_oil_desc:0 "I really don’t like Donald Trump, and his little USA just happens to be sitting on a lot of oil. Let’s take out the bastard once and for all, and take his oil while we’re at it."
 TEX_liberate_canadian_oil:0 "Liberate Canadian Oil"
 TEX_liberate_canadian_oil_desc:0 "I’m not a big fan of Canadians. They apologize too much and act a bit too British, among other things. Their oil should actually belong to me, so why don’t you tell some divisions to go get it?"
 TEX_clear_the_way_to_cali:0 "Clear the Way to Cali"
 TEX_clear_the_way_to_cali_desc:0 "A lot of wacky stuff is going on in the southwest, but we’ll need to get through it if we’re to take California. Let’s just invade and annex everything, I doubt you have a problem with that."
 TEX_liberate_cali_oil:0 "Burn the Californian Black Gold"
 TEX_liberate_cali_oil_desc:0 "Boy am I glad we can finally get rid of those damn commies! Lucky for us California has plenty of oil, just for us!"
 TEX_return_rio_grande_oil:0 "Return to Rio Grandese Oil"
 TEX_return_rio_grande_oil_desc:0 "Seriously, how’d you lose the Rio Grande? Don’t tell me it was the AI’s fault. Ok sure, it was coded with the path. Regardless, I’m here to help you take it back. Then we’ll take the rest of Mexico’s oil."
 TEX_seize_mexican_oil:0 "Seize Mexican Oil"
 TEX_seize_mexican_oil_desc:0 "What did I just say? Now that we have the Rio Grande, Mexico’s oil is as good as ours. Come on, let’s head on down to Mexico City. I could use a good taco!"
 TEX_return_new_orleans:0 "Return to New Orleans"
 TEX_return_new_orleans_desc:0 "New Orleans, haven’t been here in a while. They’ve changed the place, not sure how much I like what they’ve done with it though. I’ve got some better ideas for it, but we’ll have to take it back first."
 TEX_a_second_gulf_war:0 "A Second Gulf War"
 TEX_a_second_gulf_war_desc:0 "Haha! I get it, the Second Gulf War but it’s the Gulf of Mexico. Pretty smart if I do say so myself. But either way, this so-called Confederacy should get struck down just like the last one."
 TEX_southern_unity:0 "Unity by the Black Gold Burning"
 TEX_southern_unity_desc:0 "We all love oil here. That’ll make it pretty damn easy to assimilate the south back into our Oil Empire, we’ll make sure we control Florida while we’re at it too. I wonder if Jeb’s still around here somewhere."
 
 TEX_cut_progressive_policies:0 "Cut Progressive Policies"
 TEX_cut_progressive_policies_desc:0 "The woke progressive policies have done nothing but damage the production of oil. If they really cared about the people, they’d know that oil is a necessity! We must get rid of these policies for the betterment of oil production."
 TEX_minimal_welfare:0 "Minimal Welfare"
 TEX_minimal_welfare_desc:0 "Our experts say the people might be mad and revolt if we don’t give them at least some welfare, I suppose. We can manage fine without a bit of cash, especially if it means we stay in power."
 TEX_classism:0 "Classism"
 TEX_classism_desc:0 "The rich are better than the poor, that’s simply common knowledge. In our Texas the wealthy are elevated to a much higher status than their opposites, that’s simply how things are."
 TEX_NRA_cooperation:0 "Cooperation with the NRA"
 TEX_NRA_cooperation_desc:0 "Texans do love their guns, don’t they? The National Rifle Association would be more than happy to carve out a mutually beneficial agreement with us. Together for the future!"
 TEX_power_texan_arms_industry:0 "Empower the Texan Arms Industry"
 TEX_power_texan_arms_industry_desc:0 "If we are to truly utilize Texas’ potential, we must expand and empower its arms industry. Once we begin manufacturing large amounts of weapons we can start playing all sides of the Second American Civil War, so we always come out on top!"
 TEX_production_powerhouse:0 "A Production Powerhouse"
 TEX_production_powerhouse_desc:0 "The factories are churning out guns, tanks, planes, and more every day. We’ve turned Texas into a production powerhouse, one of the largest producers of arms on the planet. Everything is going great!"
 TEX_green_line_go_up:0 "The Line is §YALWAYS §GGreen§!"
 TEX_green_line_go_up_desc:0 "Up, up, up! That’s the direction Texas’ economy, and our bank accounts, are heading at lightning speed. The chart’s line is always bright green, soaring into the heavens! Who says this isn’t progress?"
 TEX_expand_oils_production:0 "Black is the New Gold"
 TEX_expand_oils_production_desc:0 "Gold had its time in the sun, but now its relevance is fading. Black gold, oil, has replaced it. Those who control the flow of oil control Texas, as they should. Soon they will control the world!"
 TEX_embrace_synthetics:0 "New Ways to Burn Black Gold"
 TEX_embrace_synthetics_desc:0 "We have so much oil we hardly know what to do with it! So many appliances are electric these days, let’s fix that! Give your fridge some oil! Give your microwave some oil! Everything will run on oil!"
 TEX_auto_industries_cooperation:0 "Cooperate with the Automotive Industry"
 TEX_auto_industries_cooperation_desc:0 "Nothing says Texas like a big oil guzzling truck! The automotive industry has been the number one oil customer almost as long as there has been an oil industry, and they’ll surely be overjoyed at the prospect of working together!"
 TEX_reopen_Texan_gp:0 "Reopen the Texan Grand Prix"
 TEX_reopen_Texan_gp_desc:0 "The Texan Grand Prix is fun for family, friends, and corporate executives. While everyone else gets to watch a fun race, the Oil Barons are signing contracts and using it as an opportunity to line their pockets. Entertainment is very profitable after all."
 TEX_ungreenify_the_economy:0 "Ungreenify the Economy"
 TEX_ungreenify_the_economy_desc:0 "Green energy, another creation of the woke liberals. Spending time and resources just to make an unproductive machine that only runs on electricity, why? It’s time to undo the idea of a green economy, and replace it with an oil economy!"
 TEX_rely_on_mercs:0 "Rely on Mercs"
 TEX_rely_on_mercs_desc:0 "Any sort of Texan Armed Forces are long gone, and so we’ve been using mercenaries for some time now. While some may dislike the idea of relying on people who can be hired, the Oil Barons think it just makes things simpler."
 TEX_recruit_bounty_hunters:0 "Recruit Bounty Hunters"
 TEX_recruit_bounty_hunters_desc:0 "Who needs a sheriff when you can have a bounty hunter? If someone steals from a Baron, or god forbid, kills an executive, they deserve nothing but death. Bounty hunters are exceptionally skilled at finding these criminals, and making sure they never break the law again."
 TEX_contract_private_police:0 "Contract Private Police"
 TEX_contract_private_police_desc:0 "While bounty hunters are fine for doing things for the Barons, there are still lowly criminals robbing from regular people. Our experts say if crime grows out of control, the people might revolt. The time has come to contract some private police to ensure the lesser people don’t all get robbed."
 TEX_export:0 "Endless Exports"
 TEX_export_desc:0 "Everything goes out, and the money comes flowing in. We have buyers across the globe, eager to get their hands on anything and everything we produce. Business is booming, and the Oil Barons are richer than ever!"
 TEX_arms:0 "§RGUNS§!"
 TEX_arms_desc:0 "Throughout the ruins of America, there’s a very high chance that any gun you find was built in Texas. Tanks used by both sides were built in Texas. Trump wants our planes, Biden wants our planes, everyone wants a piece of the Texan arms industry pie."
 TEX_products:0 "§YPRODUCTS§!"
 TEX_products_desc:0 "Across the world appliances, furniture, and even books are shipping in from Texas. If it exists under the sun, you can expect it is getting pumped endlessly out of a Texan factory. Our products are quickly overtaking our rivals, bringing in more and more funds."
 TEX_oil:0 "§BOIL§!"
 TEX_oil_desc:0 "The lifeblood of Texas has been spilled across the world. Cars in Germany are getting filled with our oil, tanks in Russia are getting filled with our oil, planes across the former USA are getting filled up with our oil. We have quickly overtaken most of our potential rivals and become one of the largest oil exporters on Earth, and we wouldn’t have it any other way."
 
 TEX_the_council:0 "The Council of Barons"
 TEX_the_council_desc:0 "The Barons know what’s best for Texas. They know that as long as there is oil, Texas will continue to exist. The government is theirs now, and Texans can do nothing but watch."
 TEX_limited_self_governance:0 "Limited Self Governance"
 TEX_limited_self_governance_desc:0 "The Council can’t manage all of Texas on their own, and have benevolently allowed for limited self-governance. Of course, everyone still answers to them, but maybe it’s a step in the right direction?"
 TEX_territory_for_independence:0 "Territory for Independence"
 TEX_territory_for_independence_desc:0 "The Barons know that their takeover of Texas is sure to turn some heads, but they’ve prepared for this. There is land within Texas that holds no value to them, but to others it is a dealbreaker. In exchange for guarantees of independence the Barons will give away this land."
 TEX_join_opec:0 "Join OPEC"
 TEX_join_opec_desc:0 "With Texas now exporting oil worldwide, it is time for us to join OPEC. We must ensure that the price of oil benefits us, and no one else."
 TEX_the_wva_cause:0 "The West Virginian Cause"
 TEX_the_wva_cause_desc:0 "The Barons have seen the efficiency of the West Virginian nation. In their endless wisdom they have handed over control of oil production to the Corporations in West Virginia, so long as they get to keep most of the profits."
 TEX_host_exiled_corporatists:0 "Host Exiled Corporatists"
 TEX_host_exiled_corporatists_desc:0 "Thanks to Tucker Carlson, quite possibly the most efficient nation the 21st century has ever seen has been struck down in its cradle. The Barons have taken pity on their exiles, and have invited them into Texas."
 TEX_promise_autonomy:0 "Promise Autonomy"
 TEX_promise_autonomy_desc:0 "Governing the entirety of Mexico would be an incredible challenge for OPEC, even with Texas’ help. Instead they have offered autonomy to Mexico, in exchange for the control of all their oil fields."
 TEX_re_enter_rio_grande:0 "Re-Enter the Rio Grande"
 TEX_re_enter_rio_grande_desc:0 "The Rio Grande has unfortunately been lost, but this will no longer be the case. OPEC has seen the need to re-secure the Rio, and it is time to cross the border once again."
 TEX_ensure_the_flow_of_mexican_oil:0 "Ensure the Flow of Mexican Oil"
 TEX_ensure_the_flow_of_mexican_oil_desc:0 "The ongoing civil war in Mexico has deeply damaged the nation’s oil production, something that simply must be repaired. OPEC has approved a special military operation into Mexico in order to bring back stability, and secure the oil."
 TEX_connect_the_oceans:0 "Connect the Oceans"
 TEX_connect_the_oceans_desc:0 "While Central America may have less oil than the regions around it, it does still possess some natural resources. More importantly, it’s a steppingstone to seize Panama and the canal that is so important to world trade."
 TEX_reach_out_to_chiriqui:0 "Reach Out to Chiriqui"
 TEX_reach_out_to_chiriqui_desc:0 "Just south of our border is the world-renowned Panama Canal. OPEC can almost taste it. If we can seize the canal, the profits, er, benefits will surely be great!"
 TEX_demand_colombian_military_access:0 "Demand Colombian Military Access"
 TEX_demand_colombian_military_access_desc:0 "While Colombia may not be important to OPEC as its neighbor, it still offers an opportunity for easy access to Venezuela. With their current cartel problems, Colombia isn’t really in a strong place to refuse our demands. Venezuela, here we come!"
 TEX_return_venezuelan_oil:0 "Return Venezuelan Oil"
 TEX_return_venezuelan_oil_desc:0 "It’s OPEC! Open up Venezuela, your oil is ours! Dictator? Yeah, we’re totally liberating Venezuela from Maduro, liberating their oil from him that is!"
 TEX_OPEC_desc:0 "The limited self-governance for Texas has so far worked for the Barons, but it can’t be allowed to exist permanently. Instead it has been decided that OPEC will take over governance of our nation, it is for the best."

 texas.1.t:0 "The Older Brother"
 texas.1.d:0 "Walking nervously in the hallway while he was waiting for the news whether Abbott would receive him in his office or not, George was slowly caught up in nervousness. He didn't know how to react except just nervously walking from one end of the hallway to the other. Ten minutes after he had been told to wait, Abbott's secretary came out of the office and approached George. "Mr. Bush, President Abbott said you could come in." "Thank goodness he decided to receive me." George said, and went inside while Abbott was writing something down. He was a bit annoyed that he wasn't being referred to as 'president', as he should be, but he wasn't exactly in a position to demand formalities.\n\n"Sit down, George, tell me why you came to me?" It was his words, taking his eyes off what he had been doing so far and looking directly at George.\n\n"He needs your help, Mr. Abbott. That silver-spoon fed son of even the bastard that started all this can fall if you decide to follow my advice. Jeb led an armed rebellion against him, but he possibly win on his own." George W. Bush's words were panicked as Abbott continued to look at him with the same gaze.\n\n"I'll tell you honestly, George, I don't have the time, nerve or resources to deal with your retarded brother's problem. I'm sorry to tell you this, but if your brother fucks himself over, that's his own fault."\n\n"So that's it? You fucking yellow-bellied coward. Remember this - if you ever need my support, don't even think about contacting me."\n\n"America never needed Jeb. So I doubt very much that I will need you."\n\n"Fuck you." George snapped at him, pounding furiously on the door on his way out to hear something kicking. "Hit that whore of yours that way you idiot!" Abbott shouted for George to hear him, but he was already out of the hallway. Abbott went back to his job, but something was bothering him. "Did you have to be a son of a bitch?" These were the words Abbott said to himself as he wrote something. "Of course you are. After all, you're Greg Abbott - the American son of a bitch." He continued to talk to himself. "Maybe I shouldn't have told George my opinion of Jeb like that." He continued to talk to himself, thinking that he had acted like a bit of an arse, unable to erase this from his head - thinking that he should have acted differently."
 texas.1.a:0 "Bah, it's too late now, anyway."
 
 texas.2.t:0 "The Alamo Party"
 texas.2.d:0 ""You thought there would never be a chance for real republicanism to return to our region, but here it is - standing proudly in front of you. Greg Abbott is a man you have trusted for some time. I will tell you something about his personality. Those who address him Mr. President, they don't really realize how much honor they give to that degenerative freak, that insidious cockroach! All his words are false - we all know that for a long time. Do you remember what he told you earlier? When he told you that only his ideas are good and ideas that came from someone else aren't? Does this sound familiar or do I have to draw historical lines? Greg Abbott is striving to establish communism in Texas, whose environment we love as it is and do not want to change it for the sake of some useless ideals that will sooner or later destroy everything we have fought for since our independence. He refuses to launch or support a campaign against that bastardic son who came from that idiot Trump which destroyed us together with Cruz's communist friend Biden. Please, as people and residents of Texas, as people who want to live freely in the state in which they were born - do not reach for the communist dystopia offered by Greg Abbott, but follow me - for a person who will respect your decisions. whatever they were. Republicanism will not be nearly similar to the one that introduced America to the Dark Ages. The Alamo Party will serve as a bastion of the former American values of freedom and justice that have always accompanied us. Reject Greg Abbott ideas - embrace true American values! Remember the Alamo Party! "George W. Bush's words reached every ear, and when it reached Greg Abbott's ear - anger gripped him, but there was nothing he could do about it. George W. Bush decided to go it alone against all odds and to becomes president again, after 12 years of his absence. No one will fuck around with Bush's name."
 texas.2.a:0 "The Old Man is Back!"
 
 texas.3.t:0 "Daniel Miller and the Free Texan Army"
 texas.3.d:0 "Sitting in his office and doing something about his campaign while he was occasionally furious about George W. Bush, President Greg Abbott's secretary knocked on the door. "Who is it now?" Greg asked nervously, tilting his posters to the side so no one would notice him admiring himself.\n\n"I have something that will interest you, sir. And what you should know as soon as possible."\n\n"Come in then, what are you standing at the door for?" The secretary came in, closing the door behind him, and handed Greg Abbott a few posters that appeared as well as a video from this morning's meeting in the square. "What is this about? Who is this idiot in the picture?" Greg Abbott asked his advisor.\n\n"Some guy named Daniel Miller, we don't know anything about him, there are no details about his earlier life or whether he was involved in politics. He just showed up like a bolt from the blue as an election candidate."\n\n"Oh my God, I'm going to fucking shoot myself for the idiocy going on in Texas." Greg said almost wearily after tossing aside Miller's poster. "Have you perhaps seen this man live? How is he talking? What is he talking about? What are his motives?"\n\n"Well honestly sir, it reminds me of you."\n\n"What the fuck is that supposed to mean?"\n\n"Exactly that. He likes to belittle his opponents and is rumored around him to be a high school fraud."\n\n"What should a high school fraud mean now?"\n\n"He likes to fool people."\n\n"I see."\n\n"So I wanted to bring this issue to you right away so you can see what to do with Miller, because if a miracle happens and he manages to beat you in the election, it's not going to be good for the Texas people."\n\n"Are you saying I should ban him from having a party? Huh, that's not even a bad idea ... give me a moment to think.""
 texas.3.a:0 "It's not worth the risk. Ban them."
 texas.3.b:0 "That would compromise our democracy."
 
 texas.4.t:0 "The Free Texas Army Coup"
 texas.4.d:0 "After the banning of his party, Daniel Miller's Free Texas Army began a campaign of domestic terrorism, drive-bying political opponents, and many politicians had to check their cars for bombs after a member of Greg's cabinet was blown up, the only sign that it was the Free Texas Army being the graffiti nearby, proclaiming the bombing was 'For a Free Texas'.\n\nThen, in the early hours of pre-dawn, just a few days before the election began, shots rang outside of the capital building as it was stormed, no mercy given to the security guards as they were brutally executed, quickly moving room to room and firing upon anything that moved inside of them.\n\nFinally, Daniel Miller approached Ted Cruz, flanked by several members of his organization. "Ted Cruz, you are under arrest for the perversion of Texan values and the oppression of the true Texan people," he said as two Free Texans hauled him up to his feet roughly.\n\nTed Cruz scoffed, trying to maintain some kind of control in the situation and hide his fear. "This is treason, you can't do this. No one will accept your tyranny."\n\nIgnoring what he said, Daniel Miller carried on. "You will be tried and executed for your weak will and bowing to foreign powers. Texas deserves to be free, and will not scrape her knees and lick others' boots anymore like she did under your reign." He gestured to his men, and they carried Cruz away, his struggles and attempted blows to escape their grasp all being in vain."

 texas.6.t:0 "Monarchist Rally in Austin"
 texas.6.d:0 "With political turmoil spreading across the formerly United States, some are looking towards more radical ideologies. The typical radical embraces modern far right or far left mind sets, however, a notable number of Texans have thrown their support behind the old ways of thinking, the days of Kings and Queens. While America has not seen a king since the revolution, and most importantly fought said revolution to push back the tyrannical crown, yet the Texan population seems ready to subvert the mainstream opinions of a monarchy. The movement doesn't seem to have a single leader, but spawned naturally through grass roots local groups. The Austin monarchist movement recently held a major rally, the first of its kind, where multiple speakers from across the state spoke to a crowd of thousands. They demand that an elected king be put into power soon, claiming that a king would provide enough stability to stave off the severe societal collapse suffered by neighboring states. The jury is still out on if this group could succeed or how they could do so. Polling suggests a significant minority of people would support a monarchy, but that group has continued to grow slowly over the months."
 texas.6.a:0 "We shall watch this development closely..."
 
 texas.7.t:0 "A New Path for Texas?"
 texas.7.d:0 "Greg scanned the headlines of the newspaper placed on his desk which read in large, bold letters: TEXAN MONARCHIST PARTY REACHES 30,000 MEMBERS!\n\nHe continued to read the article detailing the rise and the beliefs of the party, some of which he agreed with.\n\nHe spoke, "This seems very interesting, I should keep my eye on this."\n\nHe folded the paper and placed it into the lower compartment of his desk.\n\nGreg stood up and walked up to his secretary, speaking calmly.\n\n"I'd like to have a meeting with the leader of the Texan Monarchist Party, make it for whenever I'm available."\n\nHis secretary nodded and Greg grinned, this could be the start of a new political alliance."
 texas.7.a:0 "A Texan Kingdom?"
 
 texas.8.t:0 "Greg Fucking Abbott will get his fight!"
 texas.8.d:0 "Carrying a copy of the local newspaper and a cup of coffee in his other hand, Miller came to his office, unaware of what was actually going on in Greg Abbott's head after being informed of his activities. "Good morning Smith. How's my favorite ass?" He asked him as Smith looked at him with a puzzled face, but he was learning to get used to Miller's personality.\n\n"Uhm ... well sir, how are you?" Smith asked him afterwards so that Miller would answer him:\n\n"There were better days, honestly. Did you prepare everything for me as you did yesterday?"\n\n"Of course, sir."\n\n"Thank you friend, I'm really grateful." Miller said and then walked into his office which was full of books and portraits of several writers and politicians whom Miller personally admired and whose statements he used while earlier defending the ideals of Texas arguing that Texas must be a sovereign state because it is a natural state in to whom Texas is currently located and to whom every Texan dreams and speaks at least once a day in his life. Then he threw the newspaper on the table and, drinking coffee, took his place in the chair. "Let's see, what kind of idiocy is being written about Texas today?" He said briefly that he would take a look at the front page where George W. Bush was mentioned as an opponent of Ted Cruz, and then he opened the first page and laughed in pain. "What the fuck is this?" He cursed briefly as he watched the front-page headline "Daniel Miller banned from acting in Texas politics." to then see the text: "We received information from Greg Abbott's office on the occasion of the gathering in the square in Houston, the suspicion of every Texan that his participation in the elections will be banned has been officially confirmed. he did not address the public on this issue so we will wait for further reactions from his Texas National Front party on this statement. " Miller grabbed his head and started laughing hysterically. "SMITH! COME HERE!" Miller shouted as Smith entered the office in confusion.\n\n"What is it?"\n\n"Tell me, Smith! What sentence does the Declaration of Independence begin with?"\n\n"When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for a battle to commence?"\n\n"Exactly! Ted fucking Cruz has declared war on us and I want to destroy that shallow motherfucker in every way possible!"\n\n"What happened?" Then Miller shot Smith with the newspaper so that he would open the first page and read what was written.\n\n"Catastrophe Smith! Catastrophe! It won't end here, watch what I tell you! Ted Cruz will remember the name. No man and no government can destroy and reap the fruits of every honest man's work under the illusion of taking care of them! That retarded fool is she just did it to me! But I'm not just going to sit idly by Smith. If I'm complaining about a situation without making a suggestion how to solve it, then it's whining! And I've never cried before Smith! Listen to me now ... I have a plan.""
 texas.8.a:0 "A Plan, Sir?"
 
 texas.9.t:0 "Edward I, King of all Texans"
 texas.9.d:0 "Outside the large capitol building, crowds were cheering.  Ted sighed and adjusted his robe.  He swung upon the large doors and stepped onto the podium.  The crowds roared as they could finally see him - their King.\n\nAfter words from his close partners, Ted kneeled and was presented with a golden crown encrusted with gems from across the Texan desert.  Upon it stood the cross of Jesus Christ. \n\nThe crown was gently placed onto his head and the crowd roared and celebrated.  He was no longer Ted Cruz, he was now Edward the First of Texas and it was his duty to guide the Texan people, now and forever."
 texas.9.a:0 "God Save the King!"
 
 texas.10.t:0 "The Final Showdown"
 texas.10.d:0 "After George Bush was elected to the Presidency of Texas on a bizarre combination of Populism, Status-Quo-ism and Anti-Trumpism, he has embarked on many ventures to try to, as he puts it, 'Restore the Soul of the Nation'. From avenging his brother Jeb's fate in Florida to punishing those he deems guilty of the Civil War, it seems that the old 43rd President's venture is nearly at an end, as he held a meeting with military staff about a mass invasion of Trump's held territory. It seems that Bush is now going directly after President Trump himself."
 texas.10.a:0 "Hopefully goes a bit better than Afghanistan"
 
 texas.11.t:0 "Grand Ambitions"

 texas.12.t:0 "The Greatest Humiliation"
 texas.12.d:0 "The past century was a plague to the German people.

 texas.88.t:0 "The Election Debate"
 texas.88.d:0 "As the election season draws closer, once ignored problems become major talking points on the political stage. \n\nTo the west, New Mexican terrorists and freedom fighters have been routinely causing trouble for the Texan Garrison. The desert terrain has done well to hide the New Mexican forces, with their soldiers continuously evading the eyes of the Texans. Despite an almost continuous stream of men and equipment into the region, all attempts at quelling the resistance have failed, a fact that has reflected poorly on [TITLE] Abbott's record.\nTo the north, something less theatrical but much harder to route out has been going on. The Oklahomans, though not as numerous or daring as the New Mexicans, have been waging a war of resistance of their own. Sabotaged roads and fuel depots are the least of the Texan Garrison's worry. Refusal to supply any Texans with food and a general bad attitude have put the garrison on edge, with more than a few incidents breaking out.\nBoth of these factors combined have left Abbott with two choices. Will he allow elections to occur, potentially letting the rebels gain even more ground and break out into open resistance, or will he pause the elections, giving him time to quell the fury of New Mexico and Oklahoma, but cause discontent with the Texan people?"

 texas.94.d:0 "The morning of the execution was usually chilly, as if the Devil himself was on the grounds. With a simple wave of George Bush's hand, the executioners ripped the covers from each prisoners heads. Some in the crowd stood with somber quite tears, remembering the days where those three men, Ted Cruz, Greg Abbott, and Dan Patrick seemed to rule to world. If things had only gone slightly different, perhaps Bush and the 3 men would have been able to reconcile their differences. Once they were of the same allegiance, the Republican party of old, before the fall, but that was long ago. In a moment, these few people were surrounded by cheers and cries for blood. Bush stood and silence gripped the throats of even the proudest of men. \n\nBush asked if one of the 3 had any final words, to which Cruz spoke up, "To you Mr. Bush, you have become what you feared, a tyrannical ruler. I worked for you once, back when you believed in something greater, that life and liberty were preferable to death. Let me be your ultimate test, for I'd choose death right now over living under you. Hussien would be proud of the man you've become." \n\nThese words struck a cord with Bush, as his rage ignited throughout his body. Before either Abbott or Patrick could have their say, Bush ordered the firing squad to fire a single shot in between each man’s eyes. Their bodies fell to the floor and their life slowly faded, but Bush was not finished, as he ordered the squad to unload every bullet within their magazines into the bodies before them. The flashes for the rifles let up the scorned grin on Bushes fate, and so was the death of those 3 men, so was the death of the Republican party, so was the death of the American populist."

Governor spoke positively about the state the Republic finds itself in, along with throwing a bone to former Governor Abbott, who he served under who helped guide Texas after the fall. Abbott has thrown his endorsement behind Patrick, and Cruz plans to campaign for the Texan house of representatives, some believe he will make a run at the speaker position after picking up an easy seat. Patrick hopes to guide Texas past its reconstruction era and into its new position as a geopolitical player in North America. His campaign set forth a plan to address the problems that every day Texans deal with on a day-to-day basis. A potential Patrick administration would cut taxes, push for more privatization of the Texas power grid, and develop a tighter community within Texas through a ground up approach. The Republican Party's unity could prove useful as many polls show that voters have shifted away from the Republican Party, as moderates drift towards the Democrats and fringe voters are shifting away to the Texas National Movement. When pressed on this, Patrick claims he is not worried, and that his work ethic will bring in voters to push him over the top thus coming up election."

His policy would be a hard boarder, something he claims the Republicans have completely failed at. The migration crisis could be a wedge issue for many, and individuals are illegally crossing into Texas from all sides. Mr. Miller hopes to put a stop to it through any and all means necessary.

Schmidt hopes to reduce Texan oil production to lower carbon in the atmosphere while maintaining a surplus in the oil reserves. Some believe this plan could crash the Texan economy, due to oil being the primary production within the republic. However, Schmidt counters that we should diversify our investments and not be reliant on natural resources.

However, Dr. West has not be deterred, and has sought to promote himself as an independent and free from party influence. He is funding his campaign through single donations and his own finances. As for what his administration would consist of, West had made it clear that he would mix socialist ideals with his internal philosophy.

They claim Beto O'Rourke is too progressive, and want us to do something about it." \n\n Greg Abbott thought for a moment.

The Cancun regional government has accepted Cruz with open arms. When asked what his purpose was for being in the region, Cruz stated he was here for a family vacation. However, it looks like Cruz might be in for more than he bargained for, for the regional government has asked the former Senator to lend his experience to manning the region. Given that Cruz was in Cancun when the former United States collapsed, he already knows the terrain and could help this fallen region.

Beto attempted to build a coalition through his old campaign road map, but failed to shake his image with the past. People demanded a change and that is what Hinojosa brought. Through a combination of Latino voters, youthful voters, and other progressive democrats, Hinojosa was put over the top, and will continue on to the general election in the coming weeks. "

Riding this sentiment, Beto O’Rourke brought together his old campaign road map for one last push across the finish line. Beto focused on low income neighborhoods in Austin, while maintaining his inroads in the Dallas Suburbs.

Yet, when it was all said and done, when the great American experiment finally concluded, a British King once again rules over America. King Henry, son of King Charles III, ascended to his throne through promises of peace and security. Benjamin Franklin once said, "Those who would give up liberty for security shall have neither", many fear that America has made such an arrangement with their new King. Over the last few years, Henry has paved a path of destruction from coast to coast, taking on and defeating every challenger to his throne. The royal family has declined to comment on the newly established American Empire. However, King Henry addressed a massive crowd from his Royal Palace, official projections state that over 500,000 subjects attended the Proclamation. Henry's words made it clear that the American Empire would expand its influence beyond the former borders of the United States, when he stated, "The sun shall never set on my American Empire". It is unknown what the future will hold, given the new geo-political power expanding in the vacuum left behind in North America. Some believe that Henry will move troops across the 49th parallel, into Canada to end their Civil War. Additionally, he could expand the former State of Texas through an intervention through the Mexican international border. While we can't say for certain what his next move is, we all are waiting with bated breath."

Soon after the engine roared to life, an explosion could be seen from blocks away, as the car was engulfed in flames. The Queen and her driver died instantly, along with a mother who succumbed to her injuries while shielding her child from the blast. Many have been quick to associate blame, with many pointing towards the Mexican Republican Army, which seeks independence from Texas. Other conspiracy theorists have pointed the blame of former President George Bush, who our King beat out in the Dominions election.
