By pragmatically declaring neutrality while sticking to his values and making sure not to alienate the Republicans, he leads this Lone Star, along with other states into the future. Unfortunately, neutrality has consequences. The terrorists in the west and rebels to in the north are only fueled by our inability to join a side. We must unite a Texan state before it falls apart..."
 TEX_the_election_debate:0 "The Election Debate"
 TEX_the_election_debate_desc:0 "With independence secured for the foreseeable future, there are many now calling for elections to form a legitimate government. However, there are some in our government that argue for delayed elections due to the safety concerns posed by the New Mexican terrorists and Oklahoman rebels. They claim that the efforts and resources allocated for the election would be diverted from dealing with insurgents, and instead advocate for a more radical or authoritarian government."
 TEX_different_direction:0 "Delay the Elections"
 TEX_different_direction_desc:0 "The problem of the New Mexican terrorists in the west and the Oklahoman insurgents to the north have caused us many logistical nightmares. We are unable to hold elections until these problems are dealt with. This may end up forcing us to rely on radicalism, but radical times call for radical measures"
 TEX_monarchist_party_usa:0 "Monarchist Party USA"

 TEX_monarchist_proposal_desc:0 "In order to untie our population, we have decided to install a monarch as the head of state. We hope this will quiet down the rebels and create a more secure and safe texas."

 TEX_secure_papal_crown:0 "Pro-Monarchist Rallies"
 TEX_secure_papal_crown_desc:0 "Monarchism hasn't been that popular in America since the revolution in 1776.

By organizing rallies, we can convince the people of the benefits of monarchism and the prosperity we will have!"

 TEX_invite_radicals:0 "Use Radicals"
 TEX_invite_radicals_desc:0 "Partnering with radicals may be risky, but the pros outweigh the cons. The insurgents we're fighting are surprisingly well at combating our military techniques, and so we need new tactics. Radical groups offer just the solution to our predicament. Even if we may not see eye to eye on everything, we do agree that New Mexico and Oklahoma are rightfully ours."
 TEX_spread_them_among_rebels:0 "Displace Insurgents with Radicals"
 TEX_spread_them_among_rebels_desc:0 "We have begun the process of moving radical groups into contested regions. Several of these radical militias have already engaged with rebels in the region, and since they are being supplied with our superior weaponry the insurgents have been pushed back. They are losing this war, and they're beginning to realize it."
 TEX_work_with_tnm:0 "Work with the Texan National Movement"
 TEX_work_with_tnm_desc:0 "Daniel Miller and his Texan National Movement have, on occasion, caused us problems. However, ninety percent of the time he has been an invaluable asset loyal to the Republic of Texas. He will surely be willing to aid us in our war against New Mexican and Oklahoman rebels."
 TEX_hand_minor_military_control_to_tnm:0 "Nationalism for Unity"
 TEX_hand_minor_military_control_to_tnm_desc:0 "Most liberals act like nationalism is the worst thing that can possibly affect a country, but Abbot disagrees. Nationalism is a uniting force, bringing the people of one nation together against their rivals. It can also be used as a weapon, something Daniel Miller knows well. We will bring Texan nationalism to New Mexico and Oklahoma, cutting off the rebels supply of manpower."
 TEX_greater_concessions:0 "Concede to Unions"
 TEX_greater_concessions_desc:0 "Unions and Texas have not always gone hand-in-hand. In fact, even today there's still an ongoing feud. But the Unions want the same thing as Greg Abbot, safety and prosperity for the Texan people. The rebels in New Mexico and Oklahoma are making this challenging, so perhaps we can make a few concessions for Union support."
 TEX_finish_the_western_and_northern_rebels:0 "Finish Off the Rebels"
 TEX_finish_the_western_and_northern_rebels_desc:0 "Throughout New Mexico and Oklahoma, the rebels are on the run. Thanks to Miller, and several radical groups, the insurgents are being surrounded on all sides. It's time to eradicate them once and for all, and bring stability back to our nation."
 TEX_victory:0 "End the State of Emergency"
 TEX_victory_desc:0 "With the rebels gone, the state of emergency doesn't really have a reason to exist anymore. The people are getting fed up, which is something no one wants. Greg Abbot has declared that the state of emergency will end within the next week, and there will finally be a return to normalcy within our nation. Thank you Governor Abbot!"
 TEX_one_problem_leads_to_another:0 "An Equal and Opposite Reaction"
 TEX_one_problem_leads_to_another_desc:0 "A wise man once said every action has an equal and opposite reaction, and that is still true. Abbott has made a serious mistake. The rebels may be gone, but in their place is a strongly empowered Texan National Movement and weaponized Unions. Abbott knows now, there will be no return to normalcy for Texas in the foreseeable future."
 TEX_radical_front_merges:0 "Unite the Left"
 TEX_radical_front_merges_desc:0 "While on paper Miller might be the safer option, Abbott knows that the Unions have the support of the Texan people. In the event of a civil war, they would likely come out on top. Perhaps if Abbott works with the Unions, he'll gain more support from the people and stop any whispers of rebellion."
 TEX_cornel_west_man_of_the_people:0 "Man of the People"
 TEX_cornel_west_man_of_the_people_desc:0 "Y'know, back in my day us working class had it rough. Y'know who changed that? Governor Greg Abbott!

 TEX_left_wing_populism:0 "Left-Wing Populism"
 TEX_left_wing_populism_desc:0 "Who ever said the left can't be populist? We don't need to rally the people against any external threats when there are corporations harming your average Texan here at home! Maybe Abbott doesn't exactly agree with this rhetoric, but who cares! It's what the people want!"
 TEX_TNM_Organizes:0 "Organize the Texas National Movement"
 TEX_TNM_Organizes_desc:0 "Texans don't like Unions, at least Abbott doesn't like them. The Texan National Movement is much more reliable than the left, Abbott knows what they want. The Unions are a wild card, challenging to control for too long. Therefore it is of the utmost importance that we organize the Texan National Movement into a force capable of fighting them."
 TEX_Miller_man_of_texas:0 "Miller of the Fatherland"
 TEX_Miller_man_of_texas_desc:0 "What does Miller love more than anything? Texas! Many would call him Texas' most loyal son. The problem with the Unions is that, while they may claim to support the Texan people, they don't love the idea of Texas like Miller does. This is why he is such a valuable asset to us, he shares our dream of a greater Texas."
 TEX_organize_marches:0 "Organize Marches"
 TEX_organize_marches_desc:0 "The Texas National Movement may be preferred among the upper echelons of the Republic of Texas, but it has yet to find much support among the regular people. We'll need to change this if we want to disempower the Unions. The simplest way to do this is by holding matches and rallies across the nation. The Texas National Movement, a better future for all Texans!"
 TEX_a_peaceful_approach:0 "A Peaceful Approach"
 TEX_a_peaceful_approach_desc:0 "In the end, we're all Texans. Both the Texan National Movement and the Unions care about the people of our Republic, do we really need to fight? Perhaps Abbott can find some middle ground and bring the people together, and maybe garner some support while he's at it?"
 TEX_anti_abbott_strikes:0 "Anti-Abbott Strikes"
 TEX_anti_abbott_strikes_desc:0 "Well, of course it was going to come to this. Abbott's peaceful approach was too little too late. The Republic of Texas is already so divided, there's nothing the Governor can do. Strikes are enveloping the nation, all with the goal of forcing Abbott's resignation. All he can do now is sit back and watch. He tried, he really did."
 TEX_march_on_the_capital:0 "March on the Capital"
 TEX_march_on_the_capital_desc:0 "Greg Abbott has failed Texas. He has allowed the internal division to grow to the extent of the rest of the former United States of America. Texas is supposed to be a beacon of peace and stability in a nation torn apart, but we aren't anymore. No longer! We will march on the Capital and oust Abbott, bringing stability back to our nation!"
 TEX_act_quick:0 "Act Quick"
 TEX_act_quick_desc:0 "While our coup may have been successful, there will surely be a counter coup sooner than later. We are in a race against time to consolidate power and ensure our dreams for Texas come true. They say time always wins, but our dreams are faster."
 TEX_seize_legislative_control:0 "Seize Legislative Control"
 TEX_seize_legislative_control_desc:0 "While taking complete control of the government won't exactly be popular among the people, it's of the utmost importance we maintain our control. If the government is completely loyal to us, we can pass whatever bills and laws we deem necessary."
 TEX_ensure_lower_rank_loyalty:0 "Ensure Military Loyalty"
 TEX_ensure_lower_rank_loyalty_desc:0 "The Texan Armed Forces are bound to be upset with our coup, and that's a problem. If the military chooses Abbott's side we'll have no way to truly defend our legitimacy. Replacing officers with those loyal to us is only one piece of the puzzle, we must win over the common soldier too. We can promise increased benefits they would never see under Abbott, and even if we can't back these claims, well we'll cross that bridge when we come to it."
 TEX_seize_judiciary_control:0 "Seize Judicial Control"
 TEX_seize_judiciary_control_desc:0 "We can't have the courts calling our government ‘illegitimate' and ‘unconstitutional' so it's time to seize control. Of course this is only temporary, once we have judges loyal to our government and our new laws, we won't have a need for direct control anymore. I love democracy, don't you?"
 TEX_replace_police_officers:0 "Replace Police Officers"
 TEX_replace_police_officers_desc:0 "While the police might seem a bit too lowly to replace, even they have influence in some places. While many of them are happy as long as they get to stop criminals, there are those who are extremely loyal to Abbott. These ones are the problems, and we must weed them out and remove them. Soon there will be no trace of Abbott left, and Texas will be able to truly flourish."
 TEX_seize_remaining_executive_control:0 "Purge the Executive"
 TEX_seize_remaining_executive_control_desc:0 "There are still those loyal to Abbott within our current government, and we need to get rid of them. Purges are messy, but it's a price we must pay to ensure a brighter future for Texas."
 TEX_purge_military_high_command:0 "Purge the Officers"
 TEX_purge_military_high_command_desc:0 "No counter coup is complete without a military to back them, and the Texan Armed Forces are still mostly pro-Abbott. We must quickly remove their officers and replace them with our own. While this may damage our military's expertise, it's worth it to ensure we stay in power."
 TEX_our_rule_secured:0 "Our Rule Secured"
 TEX_our_rule_secured_desc:0 "The early days of our administration were rocked with instability and risk of collapse, but that's no longer the case. Abbott isn't a threat anymore, and our government is seen as legitimate by every faction that could reasonably back a counter coup. With our rule secured, we can finally set out to fix the problems the old Governor caused."
 
 #Radicals
 TEX_Radicalism:0 "Popular Front"
 TEX_Radicalism_desc:0 "Greg Abbott is a man of two faces. While he may claim to support the Texan people, he also actively ignores their cries for help. He empowers groups like the Texan National Movement, while claiming it's to help the people. The people need food, water, and a roof over their heads. Abbott cannot be allowed to rule any longer!"
 TEX_rise_of_populism:0 "Rise of Populism"
 TEX_rise_of_populism_desc:0 "No longer will our beautiful Texas be enslaved by oil barons and corrupt politicians. From today onwards Texas will be a nation ruled by the people, with some assistance from Cornel West of course. Chairman West, not to be confused with Kanye West, now faces an important decision. How will our nation move into the future?"
 TEX_benevolent_dictator:0 "Benevolent Dictator"
 TEX_benevolent_dictator_desc:0 "Cornel West has made his decision. While Texas is a nation of the people, it needs a government capable of protecting those people. And so the time has come for Chairman West to truly embrace his title, and to ensure the people of Texas have a protective shield above them."
 TEX_expand_executive_power:0 "Expand Executive Power"
 TEX_expand_executive_power_desc:0 "Chairman West cannot govern Texas alone, and the coup of Greg Abbott crippled the nation's already weak executive branch. If the reformed Texan Republic is to outlive West, he must ensure it has a strong government capable of leading the people after his death. However, more importantly, he must ensure the new government is cleansed of the filth that is corruption."
 TEX_crack_down_on_republicans:0 "Fuck Over Republicans"
 TEX_crack_down_on_republicans_desc:0 "While it may be true that not all Republicans are bad, their ideology extremely contradicts our own. When we look towards a brighter future, we see one without Republicans. Their party has been in shambles since the ousting of Abbott, and it's time to finish them off."
 TEX_exile_trumpists:0 "Exile Trumpists"
 TEX_exile_trumpists_desc:0 "If Republicans were bad, Trumpists are one thousand times worse. They are the reason America was brought to its knees, and we must ensure the same does not happen to our Texas. Death is too good for them, we will exile them from our country, never to return."
 TEX_cleanse_judiciary:0 "Cleanse the Judiciary"
 TEX_cleanse_judiciary_desc:0 "The most corrupt part of Texas under Greg Abbott, and potentially the old United States as a whole, was the judicial branch. How ironic is it that the people in charge of maintaining the law were instead the ones breaking it? Chairman West must ensure the judicial branch of the new government cannot be corrupted, and that the interests of the people always weigh heavier than their own."
 TEX_work_with_bernie:0 "Work With Bernie" 
 TEX_work_with_bernie_desc:0 "Comrade Sanders was among the first to champion socialism within the United States. Within California he has erected a mighty People's Republic of America, and while his relationship with China may sour some's opinion of him, he is still a fighter for the people. Working with him will surely be invaluable."
 TEX_welcome_people_in_need:0 "Welcome People in Need"
 TEX_welcome_people_in_need_desc:0 "The former USA is full of people in need, and some have immigrated here. We welcome them! Our southern neighbor has been plagued with cartel violence for years, and now civil war. This has led many to immigrate here. We welcome them! No matter where you're from, what your history is, if you're in need of aid, Texas is here for you!"
 TEX_the_common_good:0 "For the Collective Good"
 TEX_the_common_good_desc:0 "With the help of Chairman West, we have built a new Texas. A more welcoming Texas, a more accepting Texas, a better Texas.

 TEX_state_control_of_unions:0 "State Unions"
 TEX_state_control_of_unions_desc:0 "Our nation was birthed from Unions, and as such they have much power today.

Chairman West intends to reorganize the Unions into statewide organizations capable of defending the rights of Texans everywhere."
 TEX_welcome_bernie_exiles:0 "Welcome Bernite Exiles"
 TEX_welcome_bernie_exiles_desc:0 "It is a great shame that the People's Republic of America has fallen, but the dream of socialism still lives on here.

 TEX_bernie_rides_out_again:0 "Bernie Rides Out Again"
 TEX_bernie_rides_out_again_desc:0 "Today begins the reclamation of California from the invaders. An army of PRA exiles, along with Texan volunteers, have set out through the southwest with the goal of finally returning home. At their head, is Comrade Sanders. Their fate is unknown, but all Texans are cheering them on!"

 TEX_end_the_oil_barons_desc:0 "For too long the lifeblood of Texas, oil, has been owned by a greedy few. Now, they are gone, but their vast fortunes remain. With these fortunes we can fund numerous initiatives for the betterment of the people's livelihoods!"
 TEX_promote_domestic_industry:0 "Protectionism"
 TEX_promote_domestic_industry_desc:0 "Before the Second American Civil War, the economy of the USA was extremely reliant on other countries. If we want our nation to survive, we must set up our economy to rely on no one but ourselves."
 TEX_fair_compensation:0 "Fair Compensation"
 TEX_fair_compensation_desc:0 "Too many workers have suffered injuries, or even perished, doing dangerous jobs. These workers and their families usually got very little compensation unless they brought the incident to court. This simply will not do, these workers are the backbone of our nation and we must ensure they feel compensated for injuries."
 TEX_enshrine_workers_rights:0 "Enshrine Workers Rights"
 TEX_enshrine_workers_rights_desc:0 "If Chairman West had to pick one thing about the Texas he had built to outlive him, it would be workers rights. We must forge the rights of workers into the very essence of our nation, to ensure they last as long as Texans draw breath!"
 TEX_Christian_Socialism:0 "Christian Socialism"
 TEX_Christian_Socialism_desc:0 "Christianity has always been prominent in the south and Texas, and Christians were bound to be against us. While their religion doesn't have a place in government, we have no intent of removing them and would much rather work side by side."
 TEX_work_with_churches:0 "Work with Churches"
 TEX_work_with_churches_desc:0 "Churches are a place for people to come together, and so is socialism. Socialism advocates for empowering the people and uplifting those in poverty. Churches run charities aimed at feeding the poor and helping rehabilitate people. We're not so different, and can surely work together to better Texas."
 TEX_reject_marxism:0 "Reject Marxism"
 TEX_reject_marxism_desc:0 "Karl Marx once called religion the opium of the people. We do not agree with Marx, or any of the atheist Marxist socialist countries of the past. Religion is a wonderful thing, and while it shouldn't be forced on anyone, neither should the opposite."
 TEX_jesus_was_a_socialist:0 "Jesus was a Leftist"
 TEX_jesus_was_a_socialist_desc:0 "There is a saying that if Jesus ran for president he wouldn't win. Mainly because of the simple fact that Jesus was a leftist. He supported the people, and felt that everyone should be treated equally. Love your fellow man is not the kind of thing an oil baron or a politician would say, but Jesus said it. We know that Jesus would approve of our vision for Texas."
 TEX_army_of_the_people:0 "Army of the People"

 TEX_purge_unloyal_elements:0 "Purge the Greedy"
 TEX_purge_unloyal_elements_desc:0 "There are those who see the army and war as nothing more than an opportunity to line their pockets. We will not have this in our Texas. The greedy should have no place anywhere near the army."

 TEX_everyone_deserves_liberty:0 "Everyone Deserves Freedom"
 TEX_everyone_deserves_liberty_desc:0 "Cornel West has made his decision. Texas has always loved freedom, and therefore a large government would be going against the will of the people.

 TEX_minarchism:0 "Minarchist Socialism"
 TEX_minarchism_desc:0 "Cornel West has made his decision. Texas has always loved freedom, and therefore a large government would be going against the will of the people.

 TEX_promote_small_businesses_desc:0 "What's more American than small business? Everyone loves the old Ma and Pa diner in their neighborhood, or the ancient bookstore that's been there as long as their grandfather can remember. Big corporations do nothing but damage small businesses. Cornel West has decided to start a campaign to bring business back to the people."
 TEX_empower_labor_unions:0 "Transition to Syndicalism"
 TEX_empower_labor_unions_desc:0 "Syndicalism is a bit of a strange ideology, in a way it's truly as socialist as you can get without anarchism. West has seen the need for a syndicalist Texas, something many Texans have desired without exactly realizing it. The transition may be a rocky one, but it will be well worth it."
 TEX_freedom_of_speech:0 "Freedom of Speech"
 TEX_freedom_of_speech_desc:0 "It is all too common for socialist states to begin suppressing the freedom of speech Americans and Texans hold so dear. Our state would be nothing without the freedom of speech, and we would do good to remember that. The American constitution may have been flawed, but they certainly did not mess up the First Amendment."
 TEX_unironic_syndicalism:0 "Unironic Syndicalism Achieved"
 TEX_unironic_syndicalism_desc:0 "After much work, Syndicalism has been achieved. Unironically. Cornel West has successfully established the first real syndicalist nation, and things are going smoothly. Empowering the different syndicates and eradicating the rest of the government was tough, but it has been done."
 TEX_freedom_of_press:0 "Freedom of Press and Demonstration"
 TEX_freedom_of_press_desc:0 "Just like freedom of speech, the freedom of the press and right to protest are two more fundamental pillars of our democracy. Without them we become no better than the North Koreans, and may cause us to lose respect among potential allies. That is why the whole of the First Amendment must be protected."
 TEX_protect_fifth_ammendment_rights:0 "Protect the Fifth Amendment"
 TEX_protect_fifth_ammendment_rights_desc:0 "If we are to be a truly just nation, we must protect and enforce the Fifth Amendment. This is another example of the positive aspects of the American Constitution that are worth protecting. No one should be found guilty for a crime they didn't commit because of a corrupt court, and the Fifth amendment will ensure this doesn't happen."
 TEX_end_penal_slavery:0 "End Penal Slavery"
 TEX_end_penal_slavery_desc:0 "While slavery may have technically been abolished nearly two hundred years ago, it still exists to this day. Criminals deserve to be rehabilitated, not punished, and slavery certainly isn't rehabilitation. The syndicates have come together with Cornel West and agreed that penal slavery must be abolished."
 TEX_by_the_people:0 "By the People.."
 TEX_by_the_people_desc:0 "While Cornel West may have helped build the new Texas, it was truly built by the people. None of this would be possible without their blood, sweat, and tears. Many of them have lost loved ones as a result of the Second American Civil War, but they can rest easy knowing the Texas they have built will endure."
 TEX_for_the_people:0 "...For the People"
 TEX_for_the_people_desc:0 "The people did not build the new Texas for oil tycoons, or Donald Trump, or Joe Biden, they built it for themselves.

 TEX_liberate_the_world:0 "Liberate the World"
 TEX_liberate_the_world_desc:0 "We can no longer ignore the situation beyond our borders. Sooner than later someone will come out on top in the American Civil War, and they will come for us. We must act while we're ahead, and move out into the anarchy to liberate America!"

 TEX_national_front_desc:0 "The Texan National Movement has seen through Abbott's lies. While he may claim to believe in a free independent Texas, all he's done so far is divide the people. A house divided against itself cannot stand! Daniel Miller will make a much better leader than Greg Abbott, and it's time to put him in charge."
 TEX_TNM:0 "Nationalist Authority"
 TEX_TNM_desc:0 "Greg Abbott's failures have led to a loss of faith in the Texan nation, something that can not last. It's time for Daniel Miller and the Texan National Movement to bring back a true Texan identity, and show why Texas is the greatest nation to form from the remnants of the USA."
 TEX_the_Miller_gov:0 "Miller Government"
 TEX_the_Miller_gov_desc:0 "Daniel Miller has assumed full control of the government to ensure a smooth transition from Abbott to the new regime. This cannot last forever though, and he has begun to fill old government positions with his allies in the TNM. Soon the Republic of Texas will have a strong government backing Miller, and protecting all Texans!"
 TEX_national_liberalism:0 "National Liberalism"
 TEX_national_liberalism_desc:0 "Many people will tell you nationalism and liberalism cannot coexist, this simply isn’t true! In a way, liberalism is a form of nationalism. Liberalism is usually about supporting the people, and nationalism is about recognizing our people as better than others. Anyone who tells you they can’t work together is out of their mind!"
 TEX_equality_for_all_TEXANS:0 "Equality, Only for Texans"
 TEX_equality_for_all_TEXANS_desc:0 "All Texans are created equal, equally better than others. Our nation is full of those who aren’t exactly Texans, and they should know their place. The term Texan can be used as an umbrella to refer to many groups of people, but there are some groups it just doesn’t refer to. Those ones are the lessers. Texas for Texans!"
 TEX_Texan_welfare:0 "Texan Welfare"
 TEX_Texan_welfare_desc:0 "How can our nation truly be great when there are Texans living in squalor? Miller has had the idea to form several new welfare programs with the goal of helping Texans, and only Texans, with their problems. We love Miller!"
 TEX_creation_of_paramilitaries:0 "The Paramilitary Wing of the TNM"
 TEX_creation_of_paramilitaries_desc:0 "Back when the Texas National Movement was just beginning, a decision was made for it to form a paramilitary group.

Now, the time has come to reform them into Miller’s personal armed forces, loyal to no one but him."
 TEX_promote_individualism_and_independence:0 "Individualism and Independence"
 TEX_promote_individualism_and_independence_desc:0 "There are still those in our nation who identify as American thanks to decades of oppression from Washington.

 TEX_close_the_borders:0 "Close the Borders"
 TEX_close_the_borders_desc:0 "The time has come to close the border, not just with Mexico, but with everyone.

 TEX_texanize_rio_grande:0 "Texanize the Rio Grande"
 TEX_texanize_rio_grande_desc:0 "Our little venture into the Rio Grande has turned it into true Texan territory. While the people there may not be too happy with their current situation, it’s better than what’s going on in the rest of Mexico. Daniel Miller has approved a plan to spread Texan culture south of the Rio, to make sure all the people there happily accept Texas as their homeland."
 TEX_texan_primacy:0 "Texas First!"
 TEX_texan_primacy_desc:0 "Texas stands tall among the many successor and splinter states of North America. Our great nation has found the peace and stability so many others search for. Our food, money, and resources will not be given away for free. They will be given to Texas, and Texas first!"
 TEX_embrace_nationalism:0 "Replace Patriotism with Nationalism"
 TEX_embrace_nationalism_desc:0 "There’s a saying that patriotism is loving your country for what it does, and nationalism is loving your country no matter what it does. Damn straight! Everyone should love their country not matter what, especially when their country is Texas!"

 TEX_control_the_oil_barons_desc:0 "Our greatest resource is oil, and we have lots of it. However vast quantities of it are controlled by a select few, the oil barons. While we cannot simply take their resources, we can pull some strings and ensure they are loyal to us and us alone."
 TEX_push_our_limits:0 "Push Our Limits"
 TEX_push_our_limits_desc:0 "Under Miller Texas has gone to a whole new level of greatness. We must continue those ascent, and push our limits until Texas can look down on all other nations and scoff. We are great, but we can be greater!"
 TEX_greater_texas:0 "Greater Texas"
 TEX_greater_texas_desc:0 "The time has come to lay claim to all territories that once belonged to the Republic of Texas. Daniel Miller has led our nation into the future, and now it is here.

 TEX_oil_for_independence_and_territories:0 "Deal with Trump"
 TEX_oil_for_independence_and_territories_desc:0 "On much of our northern flank is the loyalist USA, run by Donald Trump. While Miller and Trump may not see eye-to-eye on everything, it’s in both’s best interests to come to an agreement. In exchange for recognizing Texan independence and the rest of Oklahoma, Texas will recognize Trump as the legitimate successor to the USA. After all, why does it matter who’s in charge of America? We aren’t part of it anymore!"
 TEX_the_Texan_industry:0 "The TEXAN Industry"
 TEX_the_Texan_industry_desc:0 "Some people will say that California or the Rust Belt has greater industry than Texas, not true!

 TEX_expand_texan_oil_production:0 "Expand Production of Our Greatest Commodity"

 TEX_achieving_texit_desc:0 "For too long external powers have played tug of war with Texas, trying to get us to back Trump or Biden. We won’t play their game any longer. America is dead, but Texas flourishes. We will never again be a slave to the USA!"
 TEX_achieve_international_recognition:0 "Get International Recognition"
 TEX_achieve_international_recognition_desc:0 "If we are to truly become a real nation, we must get recognition from the international community.

 TEX_promote_texanism:0 "Texanism"
 TEX_promote_texanism_desc:0 "Texas, for a long time, was part of the USA. This is true. But within the USA we had our own distinct culture and ideals, things that we wish to bring back in our new nation. What we will not bring back are the ideals of America, as we are no longer their puppet."
 TEX_distance_from_americanism:0 "...Over Americanism"
 TEX_distance_from_americanism_desc:0 "If we truly want Texan ideals to flourish, we can’t have them exist alongside old American ones. White Miller has done a good job replacing them, there are still some that need to be phased out. Americanism is so early 2000s!"
 TEX_reject_collective_imperialism:0 "Reject Collective Imperialism"
 TEX_reject_collective_imperialism_desc:0 "The United States of America was an extremely imperialist country. Not only did they oppress Texans, but they also oppressed countless other peoples.

 TEX_southern_unity_desc:0 "We all love oil here. That’ll make it pretty damn easy to assimilate the south back into our Oil Empire, we’ll make sure we control Florida while we’re at it too. I wonder if Jeb’s still around here somewhere."
 
 TEX_cut_progressive_policies:0 "Cut Progressive Policies"
 TEX_cut_progressive_policies_desc:0 "The woke progressive policies have done nothing but damage the production of oil. If they really cared about the people, they’d know that oil is a necessity! We must get rid of these policies for the betterment of oil production."
 TEX_minimal_welfare:0 "Minimal Welfare"
 TEX_minimal_welfare_desc:0 "Our experts say the people might be mad and revolt if we don’t give them at least some welfare, I suppose. We can manage fine without a bit of cash, especially if it means we stay in power."
 TEX_classism:0 "Classism"
 TEX_classism_desc:0 "The rich are better than the poor, that’s simply common knowledge. In our Texas the wealthy are elevated to a much higher status than their opposites, that’s simply how things are."
 TEX_NRA_cooperation:0 "Cooperation with the NRA"
 TEX_NRA_cooperation_desc:0 "Texans do love their guns, don’t they? The National Rifle Association would be more than happy to carve out a mutually beneficial agreement with us. Together for the future!"
 TEX_power_texan_arms_industry:0 "Empower the Texan Arms Industry"
 TEX_power_texan_arms_industry_desc:0 "If we are to truly utilize Texas’ potential, we must expand and empower its arms industry. Once we begin manufacturing large amounts of weapons we can start playing all sides of the Second American Civil War, so we always come out on top!"
 TEX_production_powerhouse:0 "A Production Powerhouse"
 TEX_production_powerhouse_desc:0 "The factories are churning out guns, tanks, planes, and more everyday. We’ve turned Texas into a production powerhouse, one of the largest producers of arms on the planet. Everything is going great!"
 TEX_green_line_go_up:0 "The Line is §YALWAYS §GGreen§!"
 TEX_green_line_go_up_desc:0 "Up, up, up! That’s the direction Texas’ economy, and our bank accounts, are heading at lightning speed. The chart’s line is always bright green, soaring into the heavens! Who says this isn’t progress?"
 TEX_expand_oils_production:0 "Black is the New Gold"
 TEX_expand_oils_production_desc:0 "Gold had its time in the sun, but now its relevance is fading. Black gold, oil, has replaced it. Those who control the flow of oil control Texas, as they should. Soon they will control the world!"
 TEX_embrace_synthetics:0 "New Ways to Burn Black Gold"
 TEX_embrace_synthetics_desc:0 "We have so much oil we hardly know what to do with it! So many appliances are electric these days, let’s fix that! Give your fridge some oil! Give your microwave some oil! Everything will run on oil!"
 TEX_auto_industries_cooperation:0 "Cooperate with the Automotive Industry"
 TEX_auto_industries_cooperation_desc:0 "Nothing says Texas like a big oil guzzling truck! The automotive industry has been the number one oil customer almost as long as there has been an oil industry, and they’ll surely be overjoyed at the prospect of working together!"
 TEX_reopen_Texan_gp:0 "Reopen the Texan Grand Prix"
 TEX_reopen_Texan_gp_desc:0 "The Texan Grand Prix is fun for family, friends, and corporate executives. While everyone else gets to watch a fun race, the Oil Barons are signing contracts and using it as an opportunity to line their pockets. Entertainment is very profitable after all."
 TEX_ungreenify_the_economy:0 "Ungreenify the Economy"
 TEX_ungreenify_the_economy_desc:0 "Green energy, another creation of the woke liberals. Spending time and resources just to make an unproductive machine that only runs on electricity, why? It’s time to undo the idea of a green economy, and replace it with an oil economy!"
 TEX_rely_on_mercs:0 "Rely on Mercs"
 TEX_rely_on_mercs_desc:0 "Any sort of Texan Armed Forces are long gone, and so we’ve been using mercenaries for some time now. While some may dislike the idea of relying on people who can be hired, the Oil Barons think it just makes things simpler."
 TEX_recruit_bounty_hunters:0 "Recruit Bounty Hunters"
 TEX_recruit_bounty_hunters_desc:0 "Who needs a sheriff when you can have a bounty hunter? If someone steals from a Baron, or god forbid, kills an executive, they deserve nothing but death. Bounty hunters are exceptionally skilled at finding these criminals, and making sure they never break the law again."
 TEX_contract_private_police:0 "Contract Private Police"
 TEX_contract_private_police_desc:0 "While bounty hunters are fine for doing things for the Barons, there are still lowly criminals robbing from regular people. Our experts say if crime grows out of control, the people might revolt. The time has come to contract some private police to ensure the lesser people don’t all get robbed."
 TEX_export:0 "Endless Exports"
 TEX_export_desc:0 "Everything goes out, and the money comes flowing in. We have buyers across the globe, eager to get their hands on anything and everything we produce. Business is booming, and the Oil Barons are richer than ever!"
 TEX_arms:0 "§RGUNS§!"
 TEX_arms_desc:0 "Throughout the ruins of America, there’s a very high chance that any gun you find was built in Texas. Tanks used by both sides were built in Texas. Trump wants our planes, Biden wants our planes, everyone wants a piece of the Texan arms industry pie."
 TEX_products:0 "§YPRODUCTS§!"
 TEX_products_desc:0 "Across the world appliances, furniture, and even books are shipping in from Texas. If it exists under the sun, you can expect it is getting pumped endlessly out of a Texan factory. Our products are quickly overtaking our rivals, bringing in more and more funds."
 TEX_oil:0 "§BOIL§!"
 TEX_oil_desc:0 "The lifeblood of Texas has been spilled across the world. Cars in Germany are getting filled with our oil, tanks in Russia are getting filled with our oil, planes across the former USA are getting filled up with our oil. We have quickly overtaken most of our potential rivals and become one of the largest oil exporters on Earth, and we wouldn’t have it any other way."
 
 TEX_the_council:0 "The Council of Barons"
 TEX_the_council_desc:0 "The Barons know what’s best for Texas. They know that as long as there is oil, Texas will continue to exist. The government is theirs now, and Texans can do nothing but watch."
 TEX_limited_self_governance:0 "Limited Self Governance"
 TEX_limited_self_governance_desc:0 "The Council can’t manage all of Texas on their own, and have benevolently allowed for limited self governance. Of course, everyone still answers to them, but maybe it’s a step in the right direction?"
 TEX_territory_for_independence:0 "Territory for Independence"
 TEX_territory_for_independence_desc:0 "The Barons know that their takeover of Texas is sure to turn some heads, but they’ve prepared for this. There is land within Texas that holds no value to them, but to others it is a dealbreaker. In exchange for guarantees of independence the Barons will give away this land."
 TEX_join_opec:0 "Join OPEC"
 TEX_join_opec_desc:0 "With Texas now exporting oil worldwide, it is time for us to join OPEC. We must ensure that the price of oil benefits us, and no one else."
 TEX_the_wva_cause:0 "The West Virginian Cause"
 TEX_the_wva_cause_desc:0 "The Barons have seen the efficiency of the West Virginian nation. In their endless wisdom they have handed over control of oil production to the Corporations in West Virginia, so long as they get to keep most of the profits."
 TEX_host_exiled_corporatists:0 "Host Exiled Corporatists"
 TEX_host_exiled_corporatists_desc:0 "Thanks to Tucker Carlson, quite possibly the most efficient nation the 21st century has ever seen has been struck down in its cradle. The Barons have taken pity on their exiles, and have invited them into Texas."
 TEX_promise_autonomy:0 "Promise Autonomy"
 TEX_promise_autonomy_desc:0 "Governing the entirety of Mexico would be an incredible challenge for OPEC, even with Texas’ help. Instead they have offered autonomy to Mexico, in exchange for the control of all their oil fields."
 TEX_re_enter_rio_grande:0 "Re-Enter the Rio Grande"
 TEX_re_enter_rio_grande_desc:0 "The Rio Grande has unfortunately been lost, but this will no longer be the case. OPEC has seen the need to re-secure the Rio, and it is time to cross the border once again."
 TEX_ensure_the_flow_of_mexican_oil:0 "Ensure the Flow of Mexican Oil"
 TEX_ensure_the_flow_of_mexican_oil_desc:0 "The ongoing civil war in Mexico has deeply damaged the nation’s oil production, something that simply must be repaired. OPEC has approved a special military operation into Mexico in order to bring back stability, and secure the oil."
 TEX_connect_the_oceans:0 "Connect the Oceans"
 TEX_connect_the_oceans_desc:0 "While Central America may have less oil than the regions around it, it does still possess some natural resources. More importantly, it’s a stepping stone to seize Panama and the canal that is so important to world trade."
 TEX_reach_out_to_chiriqui:0 "Reach Out to Chiriqui"
 TEX_reach_out_to_chiriqui_desc:0 "Just south of our border is the world renowned Panama Canal. OPEC can almost taste it. If we can seize the canal, the profits, er, benefits will surely be great!"
 TEX_demand_colombian_military_access:0 "Demand Colombian Military Access"
 TEX_demand_colombian_military_access_desc:0 "While Colombia may not be important to OPEC as its neighbor, it still offers an opportunity for easy access to Venezuela. With their current cartel problems, Colombia isn’t really in a strong place to refuse our demands. Venezuela, here we come!"
 TEX_return_venezuelan_oil:0 "Return Venezuelan Oil"
 TEX_return_venezuelan_oil_desc:0 "It’s OPEC! Open up Venezuela, your oil is ours! Dictator? Yeah, we’re totally liberating Venezuela from Maduro, liberating their oil from him that is!"
 TEX_OPEC_desc:0 "The limited self governance for Texas has so far worked for the Barons, but it can’t be allowed to exist permanently. Instead it has been decided that OPEC will take over governance of our nation, it is for the best."

 texas.1.t:0 "The Older Brother"
 texas.1.d:0 "Walking nervously in the hallway while he was waiting for the news whether Abbott would receive him in his office or not, George was slowly caught up in nervousness. He didn't know how to react except just nervously walking from one end of the hallway to the other. Ten minutes after he had been told to wait, Abbott's secretary came out of the office and approached George. "Mr. Bush, President Abbott said you could come in." "Thank goodness he decided to receive me." George said, and went inside while Abbott was writing something down. He was a bit annoyed that he wasn't being referred to as 'president', as he should be, but he wasn't exactly in a position to demand formalities.\n\n"Sit down, George, tell me why you came to me?" It was his words, taking his eyes off what he had been doing so far and looking directly at George.\n\n"He needs your help, Mr. Abbott. That silver-spoon fed son of even the bastard that started all this can fall if you decide to follow my advice. Jeb led an armed rebellion against him, but he possibly win on his own." George W. Bush's words were panicked as Abbott continued to look at him with the same gaze.\n\n"I'll tell you honestly, George, I don't have the time, nerve or resources to deal with your retarded brother's problem. I'm sorry to tell you this, but if your brother fucks himself over, that's his own fault."\n\n"So that's it? You fucking yellow-bellied coward. Remember this - if you ever need my support, don't even think about contacting me."\n\n"America never needed Jeb. So I doubt very much that I will need you."\n\n"Fuck you." George snapped at him, pounding furiously on the door on his way out to hear something kicking. "Hit that whore of yours that way you idiot!" Abbott shouted for George to hear him, but he was already out of the hallway. Abbott went back to his job, but something was bothering him. "Did you have to be a son of a bitch?"

Greg Abbott is a man you have trusted for some time. I will tell you something about his personality. Those who address him Mr. President, they don't really realize how much honor they give to that degenerative freak, that insidious cockroach! All his words are false - we all know that for a long time. Do you remember what he told you earlier? When he told you that only his ideas are good and ideas that came from someone else aren't? Does this sound familiar or do I have to draw historical lines? Greg Abbott is striving to establish communism in Texas, whose environment we love as it is and do not want to change it for the sake of some useless ideals that will sooner or later destroy everything we have fought for since our independence.He refuses to launch or support a campaign against that bastardic son who came from that idiot Trump which destroyed us together with Cruz's communist friend Biden. Please, as people and residents of Texas, as people who want to live freely in the state in which they were born - do not reach for the communist dystopia offered by Greg Abbott, but follow me - for a person who will respect your decisions. whatever they were. Republicanism will not be nearly similar to the one that introduced America to the Dark Ages. The Alamo Party will serve as a bastion of the former American values ​​of freedom and justice that have always accompanied us. Reject Greg Abbott ideas - embrace true American values! Remember the Alamo Party! "George W. Bush's words reached every ear, and when it reached Greg Abbott's ear - anger gripped him, but there was nothing he could do about it. George W. Bush decided to go it alone against all odds and to becomes president again, after 12 years of his absence. No one will fuck around with Bush's name."

"Ted Cruz, you are under arrest for the perversion of Texan values and the oppression of the true Texan people," he said as two Free Texans hauled him up to his feet roughly.\n\nTed Cruz scoffed, trying to maintain some kind of control in the situation and hide his fear. "This is treason, you can't do this. No one will accept your tyranny."\n\nIgnoring what he said, Daniel Miller carried on. "You will be tried and executed for your weak will and bowing to foreign powers. Texas deserves to be free, and will not scrape her knees and lick others' boots anymore like she did under your reign."

It wouldn't be easy. The capital had been filled to the brim with National Guardsmen since before the inaugeration, and by this point it was practically a fortress.\n\nMaking their way from rooftop to rooftop, with specialist equipment and grappling hooks, they soon reached the museum.

Wires could help overcome the pressure pads, and smoke can identify the lasers.\n\nThere it was- the Papal Tiara. This would one day sit upon the head of the King of Texas, whoever that may end up being. The commandos looked at each other as they contemplated this reality.

Reports have suggested that his sentence is finally out, being sentenced to death for treason in the coming nights."\n\n\n Bush takes the folder before combing through each word twice and then twice more. He sighs, realizing the crossroads that stood before him. "You know," giving a quick look to the messenger, "Jeb was always a trouble maker. Worst of all, he'd always get caught in the end. Even when we were kids, my father would always catch Jeb in the cookie jar, but never me. In fact, this whole situation could've been avoided if he would have just listened during the 2016 campaign. All of this would have been avoided but he had to screw it up. And now, his only prayer in the world is me. I have every right to leave him to his faith, let his actions finally consume him. However, I can't deny that he is family, and that does mean something doesn't it.""

He died honorably, and that is what anyone can truly hope for. He died as a man and a father, let us remember both before any other." \n\nOur majesty did not shed any tears this morning, and held a strong composer throughout. His strength will guide us all through these times. It is unknown what our next moves will be, nor what the fate of diplomatic relations between our great states will be. Only the history books will know, and as our majesty mentioned before, let us all hope they look upon these times kindly."

 texas.88.d:0 "As the election season draws closer, once ignored problems become major talking points on the political stage. \n\nTo the west, New Mexican terrorists and freedom fighters have been routinely causing trouble for the Texan Garrison. The desert terrain has done well to hide the New Mexican forces, with their soldiers continuously evading the eyes of the Texans. Despite an almost continuous stream of men and equipment into the region, all attempts at quelling the resistance have failed, a fact that has reflected poorly on [TITLE] Abbott's record.\nTo the north, something less theatrical but much harder to route out has been going on. The Oklahomans, though not as numerous or daring as the New Mexicans, have been waging a war of resistance of their own. Sabotaged roads and fuel depots are the least of the Texan Garrison's worry. Refusal to supply any Texans with food and a general bad attitude have put the garrison on edge, with more than a few incidents breaking out.\nBoth of these factors combined have left Abbott with two choices. Will he allow elections to occur, potentially letting the rebels gain even more ground and break out into open resistance, or will he pause the elections, giving him time to quell the fury of New Mexico and Oklahoma, but cause discontent with the Texan people?"

Governor spoke positively about the state the Republic finds itself in, along with throwing a bone to former Governor Abbott, who he served under, and Senator Ted Cruz, who helped guide Texas after the fall. Both men have thrown their endorsement behind Patrick, and Cruz plans to campaign for the Texan house of representatives, some believe he will make a run at the speaker position after picking up am easy seat. Patrick hopes to guide Texas past their reconstruction era and into their new position as a geopolitical player in North America. His campaign set forth a plan to address the problems that every day Texans deal with on a day to day basis. A potential Patrick administration would cut taxes, push for more privatization of the Texas power grid, and develop a tighter community within Texas through a ground up approach. The Republican parties unity could prove useful as many polls show that voters are shifted away from the Republican party, as moderates drift towards the Democrats and fringe voters are shifting away to the Texas National Movement. When pressed on this, Patrick claims he is not worried, and that his work ethic will bring in voters to push him over the top thus coming up election."

His policy would be a hard boarder, something he claims the Republicans have completely failed at. The migration crises could be a wedge issue for many, and individuals are illegally crossing into Texas from all sides. Mr. Miller hopes to put a stop to it through any and all means necessary. Many wonder if Miller's campaign can win over enough voters on the issue of immigration, but it has clearly struck a cord with thousands of donors. "

Schmidt hopes to reduce Texan oil production to lower carbon in the atmosphere while maintaining a surplus in the oil reserves. Some believe this plan could crash the Texan economy, due to oil being the primary production within the republic. However, Schmidt counters that we should diversify our investments and not be reliant on natural resources. Democrats have called for the Green Candidate to drop out of the race and join their coalitions, but Schmidt has remained firm and plans to continue campaigning until the very end. "

However, Dr. West has not be deterred, and has sought to promote himself as an independent and free from party influence. He is funding his campaign through single donations and his own finances. As for what his administration would consist of, West had made it clear that he would mix socialist ideals with his internal philosophy.

On the other hand, the Democratic could jump out with a new one in Gilberto Hinojosa, who represented Austin before the fall.
