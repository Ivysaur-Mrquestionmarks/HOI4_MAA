 stonetoss.2.a:0 "For Tejas, for Falangism!"

 stonetoss.3.t:0 "Facing the Sun"
 stonetoss.3.d:0 "It is no secret that José Angel Gutiérrez, our leader and the savior of Tejas, is getting quite old. The civil war has undoubtedly put a lot of stress on him, and the potential onset of a wider war to reclaim Aztlan may be too much for him to handle. A growing faction of Falangists, known as the 'Stone Guard', have begun openly calling for Gutiérrez to step down and allow their leader, Hans Kristian Graebener to succeed him. His qualifications? He runs a political cartoon site. While this does not sound like much, he has won over the hearts and minds of his supporter, and they are certain he will usher in a more youthful and revolutionary Falangism."

'I would also like to put some of my own guys in charge, to make sure you won't backpedal.' \n\n 'Of course, is that all?' \n\n Cruz thought for a bit longer before saying, 'Nothing more, we will meet again to discuss specifics.' \n\n And just like that, the radicals were out, and the traditionalists were in. While to Gutiérrez, Cruz represents the worst of Hispanics, those who forsake their own identity to please their gringo masters, sometimes you must shelve your own personal vendettas for the betterment of the country."
