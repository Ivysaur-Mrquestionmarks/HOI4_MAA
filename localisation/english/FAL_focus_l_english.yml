A growing faction of Falangists, known as the 'Stone Guard', have begun openly calling for Gutiérrez to step down and allow their leader, Hans Kristian Graebener to succeed him. His qualifications? He runs a political cartoon site. While this does not sound like much, he has won over the hearts and minds of his supporter, and they are certain he will usher in a more youthful and revolutionary Falangism."

 stonetoss.5.t:0 "Meeting with Cruz"
 stonetoss.5.d:0 "'So what concessions are you willing to make?' Cruz questioned \n\n Gutiérrez leaned forward and said, 'Anything, within reason.' \n\n Cruz folded his arms, 'I want a pardon on every Republican you have currently arrested, no questions asked.' \n\n 'Alright friend, done.'\n\n Cruz then interjected, 'I also want these Falangist radicals out of the government.' \n\n Gutiérrez smiled, 'Done!' \n\n Cruz seemed a little shocked at the eagerness of Gutiérrez and pressed further, 'I also want Republicans in on drafting new social legislation.' \n\n 'Of course, is that all?' \n\n Cruz leaned back in his chair and thought for a bit longer before saying, 'Nothing more, we will meet again to discuss specifics.' \n\n And just like that, the radicals were out, and the traditionalists were in. While to Gutiérrez, Cruz represents the worst of Hispanics, those who forsake their own identity to please their gringo masters, sometimes you must shelve your own personal vendettas for the betterment of the country."
 stonetoss.5.a:0 "Diplomacy triumphs over partisanship!"

 stonetoss.6.t:0 "Intervention Size Debate"
 stonetoss.6.d:0 "The matter of intervention of Mexico has been settled, we have decided to support our Catholic allies. However, our general staff is debating how large of an intervention force should be sent into Mexico. Each option has its pros and cons, and some worry that sending too large of a force will dampen public support for such an operation."
 stonetoss.6.a:0 "Only a small intervention force."
 stonetoss.6.b:0 "Organize something a bit bigger."
 stonetoss.6.c:0 "Mexico needs all the help we can get!"

 stonetoss.7.t:0 "Hypocrisy"
 stonetoss.7.d:0 "Our dear leader, Kristian Graebener, has been stirred in some recent controversy. Apparently it leaked that his staff are being directed to give all reports in English to Graebener because he actually doesn't know Spanish. His public speeches are all given in English as well, with many left scratching their heads at the apparent hypocrisy of the situation. This is not helping the new 'Spanish First' policy and now there are protests about the whole situation."
 stonetoss.7.a:0 "Someone get him Rosetta Stone! He needs to learn Spanish ASAP!"

 stonetoss.8.t:0 "The Great Speech"
 stonetoss.8.d:0 "You aren't supposed to see this crakkka!"
 stonetoss.8.a:0 "Oops"

 stonetoss.9.t:0 "Shame in El Paso"
 stonetoss.9.d:0 "Graebener walked up to the podium to address the crowd. A swarm of people all stood blankly waiting for him to speak, with multiple cameras fixed on him. The sweltering heat beat down on his face and sweat trickled down his bloated face. \n\n 'H-hello El Paso' Graebener looked down at the podium and back at the crowd. 'This nation has been through, uhm hard times.' \n\n He looked back down and picked up his script, stacking it before placing back on the podium. He nervously scanned the crowd only to see disinterested faces staring blankly at him. \n\n In desperation he blurted out, 'It's the Jews! The Jews are the one's responsible for everything! They.. they are coming for our families and uh, try to dilute our Aryanism with immigrants!' \n\n One of the guards received a messaged, presumably from Gutiérrez, and intervened. They whispered something in his ears and quickly escorted him off stage. The official reason was that he was 'needed some place else', but it was quite obvious what had happened. Overall the speech was a disaster, and has been immediately censored. However, word of mouth still gets around..." 
 stonetoss.9.a:0 "Maybe he should have stuck with comics."

 stonetoss.10.t:0 "Adiós Mr. Cruz"
 stonetoss.10.d:0 "Ted Cruz walked into Graebener's office, flanked by Falangist guards. He was the last leader of the Republicans in Texas and was brought to El Paso with supposed intention of a coalition. \n\n Cruz sat down across from Graebener and spoke, "I hear you and your buddies want to negotiate a coalition with us. If so, I have some demands." \n\n Graebener chuckled, "I don't need your demands." \n\n Cruz shot back, "Then why the hell am I even here." He quickly stood up from his seat to leave, only to be blocked by the guards. \n\n Cruz turned back around to face Graebener who was now standing, "Mr. Cruz, I have already approved your arrest for the treasonous action of selling out Tejas to the Jews. You will be executed for treason just a couple minutes from now." \n\n Immediately the guards grabbed Cruz and restrained him, forcing him out of the room, but not before Cruz shouted, "You fat bastard! You are going to drive this country into the ground! YOU NEED ME!" \n\n A little while after, a loud pop rang outside the building. Graebener only smiled,"
 stonetoss.10.a:0 ""Good riddance""
 
 stonetoss.11.t:0 "A Deal for Lousiana?"
 stonetoss.11.d:0 "Texas, or how the Falangists would say, Tejas, has approached us for deal regarding Lousiana. It is no question that we lay a heavy claim over those lands that were taken from us. However, there is a chance to peacefully resolve this as Texas is offering to sell off the remainder of Lousiana."
 stonetoss.11.a:0 "We won't let this opportunity slip through our fingers"
 stonetoss.11.b:0 "No deal."
 
 stonetoss.12.t:0 "Tejas Invites Us to the E.C.H.!"
 stonetoss.12.d:0 "Tejas, in their efforts to unite all Hispanic countries economically, have invited us to their new project, the Economic Council of Hispanidad. It is an economic union very similar to the European Union, with open borders between our countries and a singular currency, the Panamerican Peso. This is a major move and only offers us a chance to be stronger as one. However, such a union will be politically straining to our country, despite whatever economic benefits we may get from it."
 stonetoss.12.a:0 "A great initiaitve!"
 stonetoss.12.b:0 "We must be self-sufficient"
