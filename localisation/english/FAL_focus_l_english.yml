 stonetoss.1.d:0 ""The history of the United States has shown time and time again, that the people who have helped build this country will continue to be trampled upon. The only conclusion that can be surmised is that they view us as anything less than inferior." \n\n Gutiérrez's eyes scanned the crowd which had formed. Grandfathers who know the pain of gringo imperialism all too well, fathers who have been crushed by generational trauma, and the sons who hope for change. All had come to support the Falange in its time of need, Gutiérrez could not help but crack a smile to it all, but he continued. \n\n "But now our time has come. The last vestage of gringo democracy has collapsed here in Tejas and the chains around our neck have loosened. Grandfathers, fathers, and sons, hear me when I say, we can finally break the chains!" \n\n The crowd erupted into cheers and eventually into a chant of "Viva la Raza!" The white conservatives and liberals could only help but look on from the sidelines nervously. Gutiérrez, satisfied with his conclusion, stepped off the stage to greet his supporters. \n\n However before he could, his confidant and officer, Hans Graebener quickly pulled him off to the side. The situation had escalated and evolved, with splinters of the Texan Army launching an assault. New reports had also shown communist troop movement as well. No matter the case, now was not the time to be resting on our laurels. There is a war to be won."
 stonetoss.1.a:0 "Victory at all costs!"

 stonetoss.2.t:0 "Tejas Unified"
 stonetoss.2.d:0 "We have come out victorious and our phalanx flies proudly over the corpses of our enemies. We will never again be slaves to imperialists and capitalists!"
 stonetoss.2.a:0 "For Tejas, for Falangism!"

 stonetoss.3.t:0 "Facing the Sun"
 stonetoss.3.d:0 "It is no secret that José Angel Gutiérrez, our leader and the savior of Tejas, is getting up there in age. The civil war has undoubtedly put a lot of stress on him, and the potential onset of a wider war to reclaim Aztlan may be too much for him to handle. \n\n A growing faction of Falangists, known as the 'Stone Guard', have begun openly calling for Gutiérrez to step down and allow their leader, Hans Kristian Graebener to succeed him. Although he is considered a wildcard, with limited history with Gutiérrez and the Reconquista movement has a whole, he may have that youthful revolutionary fervor which is desperately needed right now. \n\n On the otherhand, more traditional elements of our ideology think him more of a grifter than someone actually devoted to our cause. Either way, Gutiérrez must either step down or affirm himself as leader."
 stonetoss.3.a:0 "We do not need this radical upstart!"
 stonetoss.3.b:0 "It is time to pass the baton to a younger generation of Falangists"

 stonetoss.4.t:0 "A Fish Out Of Water"
 stonetoss.4.d:0 "A family gathered around the television set to tune into the state news. On the TV, the headline read, "Glorious Leader Hans Graebener Meets With Locals", with the cameras focused on Graebener from multiple directions. In theory, it was supposed to be a puff piece to make Graebener look good by having him meet farmers, factory workers, and other blue collared workers and listening to issues and giving responses. What the people got instead was a very dejected and uncomfortable Hans Graebener, who seemed like he couldn't care less about the people he talked to. It didn't help that many of these workers were Latinos, which Graebener seemed even more disinterested in. Reportedly, most viewers came away with strong negative opinions of Graebener, with the entire segment pulled off the air shortly after. However, it did not stop certain dissenters from posting clips of it all over social media, mocking him."
 stonetoss.4.a:0 "Damn it!"
 
 stonetoss.5.t:0 "Broken Glass in Dallas"
 stonetoss.5.d:0 "A couple days after Hans Graebener broadcasted one of his tirades against the Jews, a group of Falangists and Neo-Nazis organized a march through Dallas, more specifically the Jewish part of Dallas to terrorize the locals. While this is exactly what happened and was expected, what was not expected was the extreme uproar that many citizens had to this event. Both conservatives and liberals were equally horrified at the events that unfolded in Dallas, resulting in backlash from every aisle of the political spectrum. Even the mayor of Dallas, hand picked by the Falangist party, was forced to denounce the events. While we have already moved to deny any involvement in the march, many people are pointing the blame at Graebener's recent rhetoric. It seems like despite it all, the Tejan people have no stomach for violence or Antisemetism, resulting in this near catastrophic response."
 stonetoss.5.a:0 "Not good..."

 stonetoss.6.t:0 "Intervention Size Debate"
 stonetoss.6.d:0 "The matter of intervention of Mexico has been settled, we have decided to support our Catholic allies. However, our general staff is debating how large of an intervention force should be sent into Mexico. Each option has its pros and cons, and some worry that sending too large of a force will dampen public support for such an operation."

 stonetoss.9.d:0 "Graebener walked up to the podium to address the crowd. A swarm of people all stood blankly waiting for him to speak, with multiple cameras fixed on him. The sweltering heat beat down on his face and sweat trickled down his bloated face. \n\n 'H-hello El Paso' Graebener looked down at the podium and back at the crowd. 'This nation has been through, uhm hard times.' \n\n He looked back down and picked up his script, stacking it before placing back on the podium. He nervously scanned the crowd only to see disinterested faces staring blankly at him. \n\n In desperation he blurted out, 'It's the Jews! The Jews are the one's responsible for everything! They.. they are coming for our families and uh, try to dilute our Aryanism with immigrants!' \n\n One of the guards received a messaged, presumably from Gutiérrez, and intervened. They whispered something in his ears and quickly escorted him off stage. The official reason was that he was 'needed some place else', but it was quite obvious what had happened. Overall the speech was a disaster, and has been immediately censored. However, word of mouth still gets around..."

However, there is a chance to peacefully resolve this as Texas is offering to sell off the remainder of Lousiana."
 stonetoss.11.a:0 "We won't let this opportunity slip through our fingers"
 stonetoss.11.b:0 "No deal."
 
 stonetoss.12.t:0 "A Turbulent Day"
 stonetoss.12.d:0 "Hans Graebener, the black sheep of the Tejan Falangist movement, sat in his 'presidential' office vindicated over his numerous enemies. The old man Gutiérrez was mostly out of the picture, and the few Brown Berets in the movement were scattered into the wind. Victory was his! And his only. That was until a officer busted through the doors to deliver him the bad news.\n\nMost of Tejas was completely in ruins, torn apart by the bloody civil war. On top of that, holdouts from the remnant factions remained dug in like splinters across the nation. Even worse, many in the movement he now controlled resented him as a 'gringo larping as a Hispanic'. His reputation was dead on arrival and the whole country seemed to be tilting headfirst into another collapse. Perhaps a final collapse.\n\nThe harsh reality of control washed over him and for a second he became pale. Any failures would fall on his head, like a guillotine. He quickly recomposed himself and looked up at the slightly crooked picture of Adolf Hitler that he had hung on the wall the day he took power. This Austrian vagabond came from dirt and went on to lead a mighty nation, why couldn't he? Reinvigorated, he worked on his plans to give the people what they want..."
 stonetoss.12.a:0 "Authority."

 stonetoss.13.t:0 "When the Jew is SUS!"
 stonetoss.13.d:0 "Graebener walked over to his PC and logged into Twitter. His account had long been abandonded since the start of the Second American Civil War, when surviving the conflict was his main goal. Now he had control over one of the largest states in the now destroyed Union. He smirked at the thought of a leader posting memes on Twitter, but to him, that was the future. He had long realized the power of propaganda through that medium. \n\n His latest creation attacked the Jews, the primary target of his hatred. They had to be exposed for their mingling of Capitalist and Marxist degeneracy. He imported and posted it. \n\n A couple hours later, he came back and checked. To his delight, it was a success. It was promoted through the algorithm and got millions of unique views and over hundred thousand likes. The landscape of Twitter had changed dramatically throughout the civil war, and now he could use it to his advantage. All he had to do is outsource the account to his propaganda department."
 stonetoss.13.a:0 "Another Stonetoss Classic!"
 
 stonetoss.14.t:0 "Brain Drain in Tejas"
 stonetoss.14.d:0 "Approximately one year after our efforts to purge the degenerate and Jewish elements from our research has left our R&D departments reeling from lack of staff. Many high-ranking positions are left vacant as many departments now lack senior leadership and are scraping by with inexperienced scientists and researchers. With ramped up political persecution, many new scientists are unwilling to work for the government and have fled to other factions, resulting in the issue spiraling further out of control. It may take years for many vacant positions to be filled by those qualified. This, among other blunders, has only sparked further resentment of Graebener within the party."
 stonetoss.14.a:0 "We don't need their Jewish science anyways!"

 stonetoss.15.t:0 "Communists Organize in Secret"
 stonetoss.15.d:0 "Despite our efforts to crack down on communists throughout Tejas, reports have come out that organized resistance continues to persist. People have been arrested distributing pro-communist propaganda, with others martyring themselves by openly denouncing the government. Information about these clandestine operations have also become more difficult as even more apathetic citizens refuse to answer questions in regards to suspicious activities. It seems like we still have an uphill battle with the communist menace, and unfortunately many falangists have pointed to the weakness of leadership as a primary cause."
 stonetoss.15.a:0 "Communists are roaches!"
 
 stonetoss.16.t:0 "Fear and Loathing in Tejas"
 stonetoss.16.d:0 "These past couple of weeks have shown that the government has lost all control over the newly created Blueshirt militias. Despite their loyalty to our regime, they have begun to act increasingly rabid. Reports of looting, robbing, and beating have been connected with these Blueshirts. While this can be chalked up to young and angry men joining the ranks, it has gotten out of control! It seems like they act with impunity and target people randomly for shakedowns or sometimes just plain robbery. This has serious implications to the stability and popularity of our government and we must take steps to reel them in!"
 stonetoss.16.a:0 "This is out of control!"

 stonetoss_cruz.1.t:0 "An Olive Branch to Cruz"
 stonetoss_cruz.1.d:0 "Ever since we united Tejas under the Falangist banner, there has been resistance to our control from the Republicans. They have decried us falsely as fascists, sometimes even communists! This is just a plain misunderstanding of what we seek to accomplish. In an act of grace, we have extended an olive branch to Ted Cruz, the current leader of the Republican faction. While to Gutiérrez, Cruz represents the worst of Hispanics, those who forsake their own identity to please their gringo masters, sometimes you must shelve your own personal vendettas for the betterment of the country. Now we must wait for their response."

 stonetoss_cruz.2.t:0 "Cruz Accepts Our Invitation!"
 stonetoss_cruz.2.d:0 "After waiting with anticipation, it seems Ted Cruz has accepted our offer to reconcile our two movements. If successful, it could mean a new era of traditionalism that will unify the nation as a whole. While some of our Hispanic-American friends will not be happy at this transpiring, it is for the greater good of Tejas. They will see it in due time."
 stonetoss_cruz.2.a:0 "Unity is nearly at hand!"

 stonetoss_cruz.3.t:0 "A Successful Meeting!"
 stonetoss_cruz.3.d:0 "Gutiérrez and Cruz met with one another to discuss the potential for a wider coalition against the liberals and socialists. A couple of terms and conditions were agreed to. Some of them included: \n\n1. The release of all Republican prisoners \n2. The disavowing of Hispanic supremacy \n3. The removal of all radical falangists from positions of power, including Hans Graebener \n4. The re-establishment of the Republican party as a coalition member \n\n These were the main stipulations, with many minor ones detailing a more rigorous plan to maintain stability between the two power blocs. Nonetheless, a new era of unity has washed over Tejas, with many conservatives breathing a sigh of relief."

It is an economic union very similar to the European Union, with open borders between our countries and a singular currency, the Panamerican Peso.

At times, they meshed well together and at others seemed entirely opposed. How could he completely win the trust of Trumpist republicans? Academics pointed out that the two ideas were contradictory and that such a synthesis would risk becoming muddled and satisfactory to neither party.\n\nHowever, a thought began creeping through. Why did he actually have to synthesize anything? It would be an easy sell to the Republicans by proclaiming falangism as anti-woke. He wouldn't be lying necessarily. By taking the plunge into the culture war, Falangism might just become more palitable to the moderate conservatives. He looked back at his notes and crumpled them, tossing them into the trash can. He began to write quickly and messily.\n\nFalangism was not just anti-woke, but was bringing traditionalism back to Hispanic communities! Or so he wrote. He sprinkled in some anti-Democrat rhetoric for good measures, while posturing as pro-Trump. Looking at the rough draft, a smile couldn't help but form across his face."

 stonetoss_trump.9.d:0 "Gutiérrez has served Texas well, however his age continues to be a liability for the country. The alliance with Trump has also put further strain on his rule, as Republicans clamor for someone more favorable to Trump and vice versa. What further complicates the problem is the Hispanic community's radicalization against supposed "gringos", which makes picking a successor all the more difficult.\n\n Still, we have a couple of options that solve both issues.\n\nFirst is the most obvious option, Ted Cruz. He has already been well acquainted with the Falangist movement and is widely credited with facilitating the alliance with Trump. He is still disliked by a good chunk of the Hispanic community, but he would definitely be accepted by the Republicans.\n\nAnother option is Monica De La Cruz, a failed congressional candidate during the 2020 election. She is a Trumpite Republican through and through, and her lack of a past in politics may prove useful.\n\nThe third is veteran and politican, Tony Gonzales. With Trump endorsing him during the 2020 election, he also seems like a safe bet for Republicans. His more moderate conservatism also makes him more of a stabilizing force for the nation as well."
