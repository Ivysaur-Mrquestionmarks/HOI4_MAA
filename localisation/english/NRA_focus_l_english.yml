 NRA_The_Appalachian_Disaster_desc:0 "The board of directors have gotten grim news that many have been fearing for a while now. The communists rumored to be led by ex-Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson have begun a full blown revolt against the Corporation’s rule, causing many workers within the mines and factories to abandon their posts and join the communist snakes. While it pains for us to kill off such valuable employees and work experience, the Peabody Energy Corporation knows that if your workers do not fall in line, then it is cheaper to fire and replace them then to give in to their ludicrous demands. We’re going to have to work overtime dealing with this disaster, and pay for our loyal employees will have to be temporarily halted in order to garner funds needed to deal with the reds. Hopefully this doesn’t cause more employees to buy Carlson’s lies…"

 NRA_Conscript_New_Mercenaries_desc:0 "While the corporation has always relied on private employment of mercenary groups in order to make sure its assets were well defended, it's clear that the recent disaster has caused many of these groups to lose faith in our company and try to pull out of their contracts with us. However, making sure to remind these mercenary groups of the “real” conditions of their contracts will force them to continue their service with us, even if we have to correct their faulty memories on the fine print and terms. We can also propose the same contract to outside mercenary groups looking for work, especially those who are known to be ideologically anti-communist. One group in particular, the Vinnel group, even pledged their service to the company without us even having to make an offer to them. While this does mean one less begrudging mercenary group to pay, their well known ties with the Confederacy and the Kanyeist regime have caused some members of the board to question Vinnel’s real motives in their employment to us."

 NRA_Concessions_To_The_NRA_desc:0 "Carlson’s leftists weren’t the only group the Corporation had to deal with while overseeing West Virginia. Before the revolt, many parts of the state who claimed loyalty to the republican-tied NRA would often cause minor skirmishes with our mercenary defense forces. Due to the communist revolt however, many NRA cells seem to have turned their attention from targeting our mercenaries to targeting the leftists wherever they pop up, with many even fighting alongside and giving aid to our hired troops. Because of this, the board believes that we could get NRA cells on our side if we allow the NRA to operate in West Virginia once again. This would include opening association buildings and rifle associations in towns across the state, but there would be a clear restriction that any anti-corporate sentiment or action taken by NRA members would result in a local association being closed down and its members all punished accordingly. We have to keep a watchful eye over the NRA, as their Trumpist rhetoric since the collapse of the nation might end up causing more problems for us in the future."
 NRA_Invite_AntiCommunist_Fighters:0 "Invite Anti Communist Fighters"
 NRA_Invite_AntiCommunist_Fighters_desc:0 "Despite the current situation making many within the board of directors fear that the communists have a hold over the common people with their lies, this is far from the case. Many within and without West Virginia hold a strong hatred towards the ideology that is communism, and most are fanatical enough to even put their lives on the line in order to kill what they perceive to be the scum of the earth. If the corporation can advertise itself as a bastion of anti-communism and allow for these fanatics to operate within our borders, we can hopefully begin a wave of counter-terrorism with these groups using whatever they have at their disposal just to kill some communist bastards. We can even create a bounty system where these individuals can be rewarded various amounts of money for varying accomplishments, from simply reporting suspicious activities to bringing in communist fighters dead or alive for the company to handle. There are even ideas to bring some of these fighters into corporate sponsored mercenary groups as a way to act as political commissars, instilling the hatred of communism into the mercenaries we employ and rooting out any potential sympathizers."
 NRA_Learn_From_Pinochet:0 "Learn From Pinochet"
 NRA_Learn_From_Pinochet_desc:0 "If there is one name in history that resounds within the hearts of all anti-communists, it's Pinochet. Augusto Pinochet, president of Chile from the 70s to 90s, is famous for leading the charge against the communists slowly trying to take over his country, as well as employing the famous “Helicopter Tours” that many online anti-communists worship as the most effective way of dealing with communists. As is natural with a war like this, there are many of those living under corporate loyal areas who seem to harbor sympathy to Carlson’s terrorists, whether it be corporate employees or civilians. The board has decided that we must instill a fear into any aspiring communist or rebel, one that will be glorified in the same vein as Pinochet’s famed tours. Many probably won’t question a helicopter flying around the mountains or dense forests of Appalachia during times like these, and by the time they see the bodies falling from the aircraft, it’ll be too late for the leftist scum to talk about it to anybody anyways."
 NRA_Protect_Our_Assets:0 "Protect Our Assets"
 NRA_Protect_Our_Assets_desc:0 "When dealing with an uprising such as this, foreign funding and weapons deliveries alone won’t give the corporation the foundation needed to win. Our various domestic assets, from our energy plants to our armories and small scale manufacturing centers, have been at constant risk of communist infiltration and sabotage. The board will thus implement certain workplace “adjustments”: armed guards will be posted inside and outside of every corporate owned facility, making sure that no employees attempt any sort of sabotage of production. The guards will also patrol the various company towns and roads that surround our assets, allowing us to more effectively guard ourselves and intercept any potential communist assaults or cells preparing themselves on the outside in loyal territory. Many employees might be disturbed by the constant body checks and armed guards inside their workplace, but if anything this will help them work even harder as to not piss off any guards who think they just might be slacking in order to let the communists gain the upper hand!"

 NRA_Help_From_The_GOP_desc:0 "Despite the Peabody Energy Corporation attempting to be neutral in the conflict between the Democrats and Republicans, it's clear to the board that if we want our company’s position to survive, we need outside assistance. Naturally, the Democrats north of us would most likely refuse any pleas of assistance, despising our rule after seeing how we’ve governed West Virginia and even more so after our recent agreements with the NRA. So, the only valuable faction that we believe will be willing to give us funding is none other than the Trumpist GOP in the west. After showing the Trumpist government how we’ve allowed their loyal dogs of the NRA to operate freely within our borders, and making a good case of being fighters against the tyranny of communism, we can hopefully secure funding and overall support from the GOP that will greatly help us with fighting against the reds. We can even allow them to provide the NRA cells with proper military equipment, increasing their effectiveness in fighting the communists even more alongside our mercenaries."
 NRA_Advisors_From_Kanye:0 "Advisors From Kanye"
 NRA_Advisors_From_Kanye_desc:0 "Although our mercenary groups are as professional as money can buy, they are not all one monolith operating on the same orders and structure. Many of these groups, while given general orders by corporate loyal military analysts and strategists we’ve hired, often deploy varied tactics and plans of attack that can often lead to different mercenary groups clashing with one another or destroying precious corporation property. Because of this, the board has voted to hire military advisors and strategists from none other than Kanye himself. Despite being relatively new in existence and still plagued by internal political issues, Kanye’s Confederacy has the remnants of many professional US military personnel, much like its predecessor back during the Civil War. By making a case for ourselves to the Kanyeist regime as to the value of sending advisors our way, we can get outside help in structuring and organizing our current armed forces, being able to somewhat unify our forces when it comes to strategy and battle plans."
 NRA_Anti_Leftist_Crusade:0 "Anti Leftist Crusade"
 NRA_Anti_Leftist_Crusade_desc:0 "While the Peabody Energy Corporation attempts to pride itself on having a secular mindset, one cannot ignore the uses that religion can often have when dealing with dissent. Not only that, but our outward appearance has never been a particularly positive one, with many seeing us as just a soulless corporation that is fighting upset workers due to alleged “terrible” working conditions. So corporate’s media and marketing teams have come up with a plan: by marketing our side in this fight as being the defenders of freedom and religion against tyrannical and godless communists, we can hopefully create a reputation for ourselves as being a positive force in the world by purging West Virginia of freedom hating terrorists. We can also control what media gets shown, showing the terrible actions of the communists and all the destruction they cause while making sure our own image reinforces the idea that we are protectors of freedom and faith to the masses. Our crusade against leftism can inspire those still doubtful of our abilities to fight for our cause, increasing our potential manpower and hopefully creating soldiers that will fight and die for what they believe in for our own gain."

The Mercenaries and NRA cells, armed to the teeth with foreign bought weapons, stand ready for our Confederate advised high command to commence the final operation. Whatever fears or worries of failure the corporation has for this push into communist territory must be silenced or dealt with forcibly, as we cannot let fear plague the minds of our corporate crusaders while they prepare for the battle of their lifetimes. Soon, the fate of this entire conflict will be decided with one ending; Tucker Carlson being dragged out of whatever dirty hut he’s holed up in and beaten so hard that he’ll never be able to seduce the masses with his lies ever again!"

 NRA_Put_Them_Back_To_Work_desc:0 "It no doubt feels soul crushing to many of our workers that their alleged “liberators” ended up failing in their mission to liberate themselves from our rule, but the simple fact of the matter is that we don’t care. They wouldn’t be any better off under communist rule anyways, with the only difference being they wouldn’t even be able to afford food if history has shown us anything. So, while we’re sure it was really fun for our workers to LARP as Russians and Chinese for a while, we need to get the message out that playtime is over. We will start to put our workers back in their places and get production restarted so that we can continue rebuilding our assets and start making money in order to repay our war debts. They will unfortunately have to go without pay until further notice, and if they don’t like it then we’ll just replace them with people who do. Various construction firms that we collaborated with before the civil war seem to have survived the fighting, so we can write them various IOUs in order to convince them to collaborate with us once again and start rebuilding assets to get the money flowing once more. Some of our financial advisors have warned us about writing IOUs when we can’t guarantee payment, but what else do they suggest we do when the damn construction companies won’t work with us any other way?!"
 NRA_Call_Trump:0 "Call Trump"
 NRA_Call_Trump_desc:0 "While our relationship with Donald Trump is diminishing at best, we cannot deny that he is a potential source of money that we should try to turn to in our times of struggles. Despite our differences, Trump should no doubt be sympathetic to our cause as he himself was a man from business roots with his overreaching organization that holds control over a variety of his business ventures. While his current position is not ideal to generously give our corporation a small loan that will at the very least allow us to pay for our workers, perhaps we can make a case for ourselves that will make us appear as more of a long term investment rather than a short term one. When we call Trump, we can attempt to convince him to invest in us by giving him special privileges once he becomes president once again, especially legal ownership over the state once he returns to his proper offices. Are these promises hollow and not genuine? Absolutely, but in the modern USA, disingenuous promises are how states and people survive in this anarchy. Let’s just hope he buys it…"
 NRA_Meet_The_Mercenaries:0 "Meet The Mercenaries"

And while sure, we may have had to go behind their backs and “correct” their contracts in order for them to stay with us longer than they probably wished to, we think that our best course of action is to meet with this vast coalition of mercenaries we have assembled and to discuss things going forward. This coalition seems to be headed by the Vinnell group, a mercenary group that has suspiciously been loyal to the point where they even rejected pay raises for their services in the civil war. The Vinnell group has shown itself to be quite charismatic among their fellow mercenary groups, so we will go to them first in order to initiate a meeting with the numerous mercenary groups and discuss various things, such as further employment plans and pay discussions. Hopefully in this meeting, we can start a discussion on various things like pay decreases or laying certain underperforming groups off of the payroll completely. Make no mistake, this WILL upset some of the groups involved, but hopefully the Vinnell group can calm them down and make them accept our terms without doing anything dangerous."

While we aren’t going to completely shift our priorities away from coal and energy production, we have to begin focusing on other industries and operations in order to start seeing overall profit again. West Virginia has a variety of different opportunities for this: We could start lumber mills to sell to our partnered construction firms to help reconstruction, or we could start manufacturing civilian and military goods to a small extent to sell both domestically and abroad. We could also begin construction of company towns in order to create our own economy that the employees will have to abide by so that we won’t suffer from the challenges of our current economy. However, this will require us essentially forcing our workers out of their previous homes to live within our company towns, but at least they won’t have to pay rent! All they’d have to do is adhere to the town economy regulated and managed purely by us…"

We’ll get to work on putting in the necessary infrastructure, both physical and digital, to monitor the people living in West Virginia and to make sure that no undesirable actions happen within our workplaces and controlled areas. Now, eventually word WILL get out that we are doing this, and trying to be covert about these plans will only make the eventual discovery worse from a PR perspective.

AI, while somewhat stigmatized and seen as a joke by many in the world, could allow us to plan and manage our economic plans as many computers already do for many different corporations around the world. Not only will AI eliminate the risks of human error and bias in its calculations, but it will speed up the planning process that would normally take ages to do with human hands.

Mercenary patrols and stations will be increased tenfold in the places that are considered hotbeds for rebel activity. We also shouldn’t take any chances for rebels to leave the state and regroup either, so we’ll have to have air tight border control to make sure none slip through the cracks. Finally, we should make sure that the rebels don’t try to move their activities into low-threat areas of West Virginia, so a moderate increase of mercenary activity will have to happen there as well, regardless of what the locals think."

Of course, we will still hold a monopoly over West Virginia and its energy resources like coal, but we can allow outside investors to invest in other, trivial things such as consumer goods or entertainment.

To anybody smart enough, this is a clear disaster just waiting to happen if it goes unaddressed, so we will have to take measures to ensure that the NRA knows who is really in control of the state. We’ll begin by drafting new terms of cooperation that the NRA must follow if they wish to continue operating inside of West Virginia, such as increased adherence to corporate laws and being forced to allow us to go about our economic business without disruptions.

Collaborating with our construction company partners, we will go out into these areas and begin construction of brand new natural gas wells, which will allow us to produce natural gas alongside our primary production of coal. With these new discoveries, we can monopolize our natural gas resources by selling them to various states and groups across the USA who no doubt desperately need it, essentially causing a nation wide reliance on us in order to fuel their cars and military vehicles.

Now, naturally with this process, numerous workers will no doubt be angered at the board’s decision to replace them with emotionless machinery. We can hopefully mitigate this anger by training workers in the field of machinery maintenance, as well as reassigning them to other posts either within the same company town or reassigning them to a different company town to meet a need for workers elsewhere. Could this still cause people to be angry over our decisions? absolutely, but like always, the workers always get informed of the risks and possibilities when agreeing to their terms of employment.

After about a week of testimonies and evidence brought forward, the jury filled with Mercenaries, NRA fighters, and “independent” peers found Carlson and his groupies guilty of mass destruction and death, being given the death penalty.

We also can’t take any chances in our civilian production centers as well, so we will have to substantially increase our surveillance of civilian centers and workplaces so that none of our workers and employees get any ideas about sabotage or theft.

The brand new “Corporate Guard” will be open to anybody not willing to work in the various factories and mines that we own, where they will be trained by foreign hired professionals and trainers to give them the skills needed to protect the corporation’s assets and property in West Virginia, as well as being proud enforcers of the corporation’s will if we ever need to “repossess” assets both domestic and foreign. We will also need to put them through rigorous “Corporate Loyalty Sessions'' where they will be expected to profess their loyalty to the corporation and be indoctrinated in our values and beliefs. We also still have many loyal anti-communist fighters who served as political commissars to the mercenaries, so it would help us to reuse their skills in the new Corporate Guard. In order to incentivize the members even more, we will make a rewards system where the more loyal or corporate benefitting acts a soldier does, they will be given more options in terms of equipment and weapons, allowing them to prove their loyalty to the entire Guard by showing their better equipment. Loyalty will get you raises and new toys, while disloyalty will get you dropped out of the helicopter and labeled a communist."

We will also send out geochemical and geophysical surveys to locate previously unknown deposits of coal, where we then can begin construction on more coal extraction centers to fuel our industry even more. There will no doubt be many within and without West Virginia that will bitch and complain about this move, crying about the “poor environment” and the “unhealthy effects of coal on people ''.

From this day forward, any semblance of a desire in our workers to organize and get their precious “rights”  will immediately be responded with harsh punishment and mass firings. Unless an arrest worker can plead their case and distance themselves from any of these ideals or movements, they will be sent to our labor prisons to work for the corporation for free until their sentences are up, where they then can go back to working for the corporation with their pays permanently slashed for the rest of their lives.

We are on the verge of making a system that works and that many other states can emulate for themselves, and people would rather bitch and complain about hotter summers and warmer winters than actual progress?!

So, if the entire nation and world hates us for who we are, then we will return the feeling tenfold.

As bold of a claim as this might be coming from us, we cannot deny that if the Confederacy gets too close and too cocky, we will eventually be on their chopping block.

Since our government has never had to deal with the bureaucracy and lawmaking involved with holding several trade and military ports, we will have to create that bureaucracy from scratch if we want to keep the beach and profit from the ports on it. This will take an arduously long time, having to meet with local fishermen businesses and look at past examples for how this has been done, but our end goal is eventually to get the ports up and running again so that our economy can continue its growth.

We can do this by injecting the food given to them with stimulants and drugs, or by just outright giving them the drugs outright in order to see the immediate effects. Another idea proposed is related to the Corporate Guard, and how certain drugs or stimulants can improve combat effectiveness and proficiency in order to make them better soldiers.
