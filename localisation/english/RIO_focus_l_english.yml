 national_guard.1.t:0 "Welcome to Rio Grande!"
 national_guard.1.d:0 "Hello Soldier! You have finally made it to Piedras Negras. You are the last of the reinforcements now that we are to control a separate entity from Texas. I don’t know if I totally agree with this idea, but orders are orders. We got Settlers moving in from the North and Migrants from the South so you should be pretty busy for the next few years. Haha! Don’t worry soldier you will do fine. I’m certain nothing really bad should happen. Now move out!"
 national_guard.1.a:0 "Don't stay for too long..."
 
 national_guard.2.t:0 "Orders From the Boss"
 national_guard.2.d:0 "We have received a communique from Austin: You will listen to anything we say, soldiers. You got that? We have heard you are acting above your authority. To prove your loyalty you must solve the following problems within 360 days: The Settlers must be integrated into the new lands, the Migrants must be integrated and welcomed so stop the flow into Texas, and we need you to find the best Taco Chef in Rio Grande and bring him to Austin. We Wish you Luck for you do not want to know the consequences if you fail..."
 national_guard.2.a:0 "We must obey"
 national_guard.2.b:0 "To hell with them!"
 
 national_guard.3.t:0 "Loyalty to Texas Affirmed"
 national_guard.3.d:0 "While some may have called the Texan demands unconscionable, we believed in ourselves, and now it's time to reap the benefits of our continued loyalty. Rio and Texas stand together as Brothers, once and for all!"
 national_guard.3.a:0 "Onwards!"
 
 national_guard.4.t:0 "The Declaration of Independence"
 national_guard.4.d:0 "We have made the preparations and the time has come. We will send a communique to Austin telling them that we declare independence, and that we are not scared and we will fight to the death for our freedom. What? We have heard back already. Well read it! "We have received your communique and we have decided to accept your ultimatum.""
 national_guard.4.a:0 "They... Accepted???"
 
 national_guard.5.t:0 "Rio Grande Declares Independence From Us!"

 national_guard.7.t:0 "The Power Struggle Ends"
 national_guard.7.d:0 "We didn’t know the situation would devolve this quickly, so we acted fast to defend our position. First the Settlers tried to take over spouting their notions of the Revival of American Civilization or some nonsense like that. They would be repulsed from Piedras Negras, but before we could put down the threat, the locals and migrants took up arms against us as well. It was a hard fight, but Piedras Negras held once more. Captured combatants from both sides say the "turntables" are on their side. What a load of crock. We are now unstoppable. Time to break their "turntables" and restore order in Rio Grande. "
 national_guard.7.a:0 "The National Guard is the beacon of normality!"
 
 national_guard.8.t:0 "The Power Struggle Ends"
 national_guard.8.d:0 "With independence from Texas affirmed the turntables began to spin. With some luck and grit we have secured their favor and Rio Grande is ours! With the National Guard cutting themselves off from their Yanqui benefactors in Texas it was easy to overwhelm them and recapture the city of Piedras Negras from the Yanqui occupiers. With the National Guard defeated the Yanqui settlers set out to destroy us, However their xenophobia clouded their judgment and they were soundly defeated by the truly best people. ¡Abajo los Yanquis! ¡Liberación para Río Grande!"
 national_guard.8.a:0 "Rio Grande is now in the hands of its rightful owners"
 
 national_guard.9.t:0 "The Power Struggle Ends"
 national_guard.9.d:0 "We have finally ceased our lands that we were God-given! The national guard has conceded to our numbers and the Hispanic populations have been entirely de-armed! Now, with the government of the foreign national guard, and any potential resistance from the Hispanics is all but impossible. We have finally opened the grand southern frontier. All for ourselves! Given to us alone to conquer!"
 national_guard.9.a:0 "Manifest destiny knows no bounds!"
 
 national_guard.10.t:0 "Trial of the settlers"
 national_guard.10.d:0 "The Yanqui Settlers were thoroughly outed for their crimes against humanity. They were found guilty for their crimes, and now we have the choice of "deporting" them or forcing them to work for us. Many say that they deserve what is coming to them with their "deportation", while others mainly inside our financial sector say that we can use these genocidal racists to further our economic development. The Judge decides:"

 national_guard.10.b:0 "Penal Slavery"
 
 national_guard.11.t:0 "Trial of the National Guard"
 national_guard.11.d:0 "The Texas National Guard. The Yanquis who on orders from their Oil Lords in their homeland put ours to the torch alongside the Settlers and The American Border Patrol. We now have them at our mercy. The jury has ruled them guilty for their crimes against us. Now it's up to the Judge to determine their sentence:"
 national_guard.11.a:0 "Cannon Fodder"
 national_guard.11.b:0 "Penal Slavery"
 
 national_guard.12.t:0 "Elections!"
 national_guard.12.d:0 "Election Day is Here! \nWe have 3 candidates on the ballot for the next leader of our great republic:\n\nSonia Villarreal was the Mayor of Piedras Negras before the Yanqui colonization and a member of the PRI and is expected to still be loyal to the party.\n\nJacobo Rodriguez was the Municipal President of Piedras Negras before the Yanqui colonization and a member of the MORENA party. He is also considered Tijerina’s successor within MORENA circles.\n\nLorenzo Menera has always been the butt of the joke of Coahuila politics. Running many different independent leftist campaigns for many different positions and never winning. His joke would probably be funny if his family wasn’t known to have cartel links. And he is considered the man behind the death threats sent to the other candidates.\n\nBut who will end up winning?"
 national_guard.12.a:0 "The PRI Make a Comeback!"
 national_guard.12.b:0 "MORENA Wins!"
 national_guard.12.c:0 "A Dark Horse Indpendent Pulls Through!"
 
 national_guard.13.t:0 "Death of Santana Tijerina"
 national_guard.13.d:0 "Santana Armando Guadiana Tijerina was an average man for most of his life. He became a civil engineer with a Master of Science specializing in Operations Research from the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education. Getting involved in local politics in the 70s before doing many things, such as spending over 10 years as a board member and president of 2 sports teams, joining the Association of Mining Engineers, Metallurgists, and Geologists of Mexico, and was Councilor of the Mining Chamber of Mexico. He returned to politics in 2018 running for the Coahuila State Senate for the MORENA party winning with 510 thousand votes. When Mexico collapsed he remained a local leader even through the Yanqui colonization. When everything came to a head he successfully led us through to our victory over the Yanquis. Just when he was to lead as to glory he died of prostate cancer. We now have no leader. The Nation Mourns. Descansa en paz nuestro líder."
