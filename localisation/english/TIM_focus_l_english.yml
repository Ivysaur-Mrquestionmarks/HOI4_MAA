 TIM_compound:0 "Under the Eyes of the Compound"
 TIM_compound_desc:0 "Although they rarely leave the confines of the Compound itself, the security services and the volunteer army they helped to raise keep a strong hold on the people of Hagerstown. They put up enough resistance to keep Bidenist forces out- for now- so they hold complete 'control' over the area.\n\nHowever, the lack of any interaction at all with the locals outside the gathering of supplies has lead to disillusionment."
