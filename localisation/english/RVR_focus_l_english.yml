 virginia_republicans.1.d:0 "With Virginia finally united, our destiny is clear... Virginia needs a monarch to rule its lands to prevent the election of any Democrats who may want to harm the God-Fearing people of Virginia. \n\nMcDonnell, accepting his role as a transition figure has announced that he shall resign following the choice of the King of Virginia. \nVirginian history is rich with noteworthy figures, so the choices for King are obvious to the outside world. \nWe could grant Robert E. Lee V the crown, as he is not only a descendent of the famed Virginian General, Robert E. Lee but also a descendent of George Washington through George Washington Parke Custis. \nMany in Virginia also support the elevation of Lawrence Shaffner to King of Virginia, as he is related to George Washington through his nephew, Bushrod Washington, and would have been the owner of the Mount Vernon Estate if it had not been sold. These men are descendants of people who helped shape Virginia into what it is today, but there is one more choice for Virginia... \nMalcolm Murray, The 14th Earl of Dunmore, descendent of John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, and the last British colonial governor of Virginia."
