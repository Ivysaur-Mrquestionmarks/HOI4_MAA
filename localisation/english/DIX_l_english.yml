 ## Events

 Dixie.1.t:0 "Debug"
 Dixie.1.d:0 "Bro wtf how did you get this. Anyways i'll use this event to shout out Ivysaur, Aero, and Goldenhat for their constant and consitant help for the mod.\n\n -Turklander."
 Dixie.1.a:0 "Three Cheers to the MAA Dev Team!"
 Dixie.2.t:0 "Opening of the Electoral Season"
 Dixie.2.d:0 "After Governor Kemp relinquished his emergency powers and initiated free elections, many candidates are now eyeing up the ticket to lead  the Republic of Dixie. The most notable Democratic candidates include former representative Gene Taylor and former senator Jim Webb. The most notable Republican candidates include notorious former senator Tom Cotton, former United States Marine and youngest recipient of the Medal of Honor Kyle Carpenter, and notorious southern musical artist Hank Williams Jr. in his late 70s. Finally, running as self-proclaimed ''Sons of the South'' are John Betram-Davis, the descendent of the famed Jefferson Davis, Paul Thurmond, and George Wallace Jr., children of notable civil rights era segregationists Strom Thurmond and George Wallace respectively. There are also brewing rumors that voters want Brian Kemp to return as the elected president, however these are nothing but rumors of course. Who shall Dixie choose in their first election?"
 Dixie.2.a:0 "I can't wait!"
 dixie.3.t:0 "A Vote From Home..."
 dixie.3.d:0 "Despite the controversy of mail-in voting since the 2020 election, which contributed to the outbreak of the 2nd American Civil War, the Dixie legislature was able to swiftly pass through laws permitting mail-in voting across the nation for the upcoming election due to the sheer amount of casualties of the southern civil war, which included politicians. The decision met very light opposition from extreme right-wing voters around the nation, however more leftist and moderate voters were fine with the legalization. What will this mean for the upcoming election?"
 dixie.3.a:0 "...Is Still a Vote"
 dixie.4.t:0 "Sweet Home Alabama"
 dixie.4.d:0 "The State of Alabama has a prominent conservative electoral history. However, with controversy springing back in the Alabama Senate Special Election in 2017, Democratic candidate Doug Jones was able to come up with the electoral victory after his opponent Roy Moore had multiple sexual assault allegations against him, becoming the first Democrat since 1997 to be an Alabama senator. He was replaced in the 2020 election by Republican Tommy Tuberville for a short time before Tuberville lost his seat amongst the chaos of the 2nd American Civil War. Primarily considered a safe conservative state, a victory here by the Republicans or the Dixiecrats would be expected; however, votes being split amongst the conservative parties could lead the Democrats to carry Alabama, as long as they can properly appeal to the moderate voters in the state."
 dixie.4.a:0 "Wallace Jr. fills the shoes of Dear Ol' Dad."
 dixie.4.b:0 "The Two-Party Divide Remains"
 dixie.4.c:0 "Alabama Loves the Federalists!"
 dixie.4.e:0 "Welcome Home Mr. Williams!"
 dixie.5.t:0 "Regnat Populus"
 dixie.5.d:0 "The State of Arkansas, positioned down the Mississippi River to the north of Louisiana, has always been a reliably conservative state like many others in the south, however politically they had voted Democrats into their house and senate up until around 2010. What was considered a safe Republican state in the last few elections of the United States, it's still very likely to vote for a Republican candidate, especially being the home state of former Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, who is one of the prominent Republican candidates. If the Dixiecrats are able to compete in Arkansas and appeal to conservative voters in the state, then the Democrats could swoop in and possibly grab the moderate vote due to possible Republican-Dixiecrat vote splitting."
 dixie.5.a:0 "The Most Solid of the South!"
 dixie.5.b:0 "It's either Blue or Red!"
 dixie.5.c:0 "The People Rule Indeed!"
 dixie.5.e:0 "Cotton Sweeps his Homestate"
 dixie.6.t:0 "A Divided, Destroyed State"
 dixie.6.d:0 "Positioned where the Mississippi River meets the Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana once encompassed the hub of French culture and people in the United States before years of American culture swept that to the side. Louisiana is home to New Orleans, which on its own could swing Louisiana left or right in this upcoming election. The Republicans and Dixiecrats need to appeal to the usual conservative voters which have carried the state to Republican victories since the 2000 election. The Democrats must hope that vote splitting occurs among the right, and they're able to appeal to inner-city voters in New Orleans to secure a win in the state. Being the place of the most dangerous fighting during the Civil War, and only having half of his orgininal territory, Louisiana will certainly be a toss-up."
 dixie.6.a:0 "Thurmond 1948! Thurmond [GetYear]!"
 dixie.6.b:0 "Red or Blue, don't care who!"
 dixie.6.c:0 "The Gays still have Voting Rights!"
 dixie.6.e:0 "The Gay Rebellion left its Mark"
 dixie.7.t:0 "Smooth as Whiskey"
 dixie.7.d:0 "Election fever hits Tennessee, a state that stretches from the Mississippi River to the Appalachians, it has had a prominent conservative background, with a Democrat not holding a senate seat since the 90s in the former United States. As an aforementioned prominent conservative state, it's likely to be contested between the Republican Party and the Dixiecrats. The blue cities of Nashville and Memphis may be enough to carry the Democrats to a victory here if the vote between the Republicans and Dixiecrats splits enough, but the Democrats have a lot of work to do to make that happen."
 dixie.7.a:0 "Preston Parks Marches On!"
 dixie.7.b:0 "Bill Lee Endorses The Party!"
 dixie.7.c:0 "The Blue Buckle of the Belt!"
 dixie.8.t:0 "Oh, Beautiful Magnolia"
 dixie.8.d:0 "Mississippi, the state which shares its name with the river we all know and love, has always had a competitive history between the politics of the Republican voters in the state and the Democrat voters in the black belt. Despite this ongoing political competititon, Mississippi hasn't gone for the Democrats in a presidential race since the 1976 election, back when some Democrats were still running a conservative platform. Fierce competition between the Republicans and Dixiecrats could create a scenario where the Democrats, if able to appeal properly to the black belt voters, will be able to successfully carry the state, however that'll only be if the Republicans and Dixiecrats split the conservative vote."
 dixie.8.a:0 "Heritage, Not Hate!"
 dixie.8.b:0 "Reds Vs. Blues"
 dixie.8.c:0 "The Federalist Banner Waves!"
 dixie.8.e:0 "Republicanism Holds!"
 dixie.9.t:0 "Georgia On My Mind"
 dixie.9.d:0 "Georgia, a swing state in the final election of the former United States, it has been in the forefront of American politics. The home state of President Kemp, and one of the most densely populated states in Dixie, it'll be very competitive in this upcoming election. Due to the dense population of Atlanta, the city itself has control over which way the vote swings in Georgia, and even the slightest vote split between the Republicans and Dixiecrats ensures a Democrat victory if they can win over inner city voters in Atlanta and other urban parts of the state. The Republicans and Dixiecrats have to play it careful here. There are also brewing rumors that the people of Georgia want to write-in Brian Kemp to bring him back into power, however these are bland rumors making their way into the heads of pollsters."
 dixie.9.a:0 "An Unexpected Victory!"
 dixie.9.b:0 "The Peach Industry goes Red!"
 dixie.9.c:0 "The Urbanites Swing the Vote!"
 dixie.9.e:0 "Kemp! Kemp! Kemp! Kemp!"
 dixie.10.t:0 "Oh My Sweet Carolina!"
 dixie.10.d:0 "The Carolinas, two states split in half between north and south. North and South Carolina border the Atlantic Ocean, and North Carolina stretches inward to the Appalachians. South Carolina has had a very Republican history during the last 20 years of the United States before the civil war, however with the competition between Republicans and Dixiecrats over the conservative vote beginning to show itself in polling, it's clear that one of them needs to win by a decent margin to prevent vote splitting, which could grant the Democrats a victory in the state. As for North Carolina, it had been a swing states in multiple elections near the end of the United States, and a slight vote split between Republicans and Dixiecrats is sure to hand it over to the Democrats as long as they can win over the urban voters in Charlotte as they have for a while now. These two states could be a make or break for some of these candidates."
 dixie.10.a:0 "The Home of Thurmond Holds!"
 dixie.10.b:0 "Graham Endorses Carpenter!"
 dixie.10.c:0 "We Remember Jaime Harrison!"
 dixie.10.e:0 "True Liberty Prevails"
 dixie.11.t:0 "The Last Vote"
 dixie.11.d:0 "As the campaign trail comes to an end, we recall the old times not forgotten that each candidate had on the campaign trail. From once safe Republican states now being forced to receive the attention of a Democratic presidential campaign, to the competitive polling we've seen amongst every state on the trail, now comes a time where we put all of that to the side and see which party comes out on top and guides Dixie down its future path. In Dixie Land, I'll take my stand to live and die in Dixie. Away, away, away down south in Dixie."
 dixie.11.a:0 "If You Ain't Right... You're Wrong!"
 dixie.11.b:0 "A Blue Confederacy?"
 dixie.11.c:0 "The True South Rises Again!"
 dixie.11.e:0 "Kemp Wins Through Electoral Write-Ins"
