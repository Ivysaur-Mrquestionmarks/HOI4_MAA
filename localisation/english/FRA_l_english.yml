After the chaos of the past few months finally started to settle down, the time to build the administration has arrived.\nJoe Biden has a long road ahead of him, but he has very limited time considering his age."
 FRA_battle_soul_nation:0 "Battle for the Soul of the Nation"
 FRA_battle_soul_nation_desc:0 "The fight for land is a simple one. Whoever has the bigger guns wins. However, war goes one step deeper than that, deeper on a personal level, for you must win the soul of the people as well. While we are mainly confined to New England for the time being, we have still won the hearts and minds of citizens across America, truly the greatest feat we have accomplished thus far."
 FRA_lifeguard_from_delaware:0 "The Lifeguard from Delaware"
 FRA_lifeguard_from_delaware_desc:0 "The figurehead atop our nation, President Biden, has been steadfast in his fight against Donald Trump’s Midwestern fiefdom. His resolve and determination has earned him the nickname “The Lifeguard from Delaware.” A lifeguard he truly is, watching over us as we have our fun, ensuring we stay safe."
 FRA_house_divided_cannot_Stand:0 "A House Divided Cannot Stand"
 FRA_house_divided_cannot_Stand_desc:0 "It was Abraham Lincoln who once said that a house divided against itself cannot stand. As the legitimate, democratic successor to the United States, we have a democratic Congress. This means that everyone in the government does not always get along, which is just part of the whims of democracy. However in these trying times unity is paramount, and President Biden must stress this to Congress."
 FRA_assemble_the_cabinet:0 "Assemble the Cabinet"
 FRA_assemble_the_cabinet_desc:0 "While it is inevitable we will go head to head with Donald Trump sometime in the future, for the time being we have the opportunity to achieve some domestic reforms. The early days of Biden’s presidency were so hectic he could do nothing but certify his control over the states who recognized his legitimacy. Now that we find ourselves in a time of peace, he can begin to work towards his goals our nation. But first, he needs to assemble the team."
 
 FRA_reform:0 "Calm the Progressives"
 FRA_reform_desc:0 "Several Progressive factions within our government have been afraid that we might fall into centrism in moderacy in hopes of preserving a relationship with the Republicans. We must get rid of this silly notion, and assure the Progressives of our bright future with them by our side."
 FRA_protect_lgbt:0 "Protect the LGBTQ+ Community"
 FRA_protect_lgbt_desc:0 "The LGBTQ+ community has been oppressed for most of history, with the most flourishing communities getting crushed by authoritarians. We cannot led such an abused minority suffer any longer, so it is our duty as the leaders of America to ensure that they remain protected."
 FRA_obamacare:0 "Obamacare"
 FRA_obamacare_desc:0 "Trump did his best to tear down all the good work that former President Obama did to help Americans in need. Now that he has gone and committed treason, we have no reason to respect his past actions, and we can bring back Obama-era medical policy without issue."
 FRA_american_climate_corps:0 "American Climate Corps"
 FRA_american_climate_corps_desc:0 "Climate change is very real, and with the chaos consuming America, it is more important than ever to make sure that our environmental impact is as low as possible. To achieve this, a think tank of the nation’s greatest environmentalists will work with lawmakers to achieve a green America."
 FRA_legalize_marijuana:0 "Legalize Marijuana"
 FRA_legalize_marijuana_desc:0 "A true green America wouldn’t exist without this wonderful plant. From its medical uses to its recreational uses, there’s very little marijuana can’t do wrong. It’s absurd to ban a harmless plant that could help thousands if not millions of Americans deal with the reality of the world."
 FRA_gun_owners_are_malarkey:0 "Gun Ownership is MALARKEY!"
 FRA_gun_owners_are_malarkey_desc:0 "Guns kill people, period! We can’t let our people run around the streets shooting whoever wherever whenever! That’s malarkey, and I won’t stand for it!"
 FRA_maga_is_malarkey:0 "MAGA Extremists are MALARKEY!"
 FRA_maga_is_malarkey_desc:0 "MAGA? That’s MALARKEY! I will NOT have MAGA malarkey in MY AMERICA!"

 FRA_we_own_finish_line_desc:0 "The future is to be built by American hands, our hands. It is our destiny to do great things, and that’s exactly what will be done. We set, make, and achieve our goals without breaking a sweat. We’re back baby!"
 FRA_national_vaccine_mandate:0 "Introduce a National Vaccine Mandate"
 FRA_national_vaccine_mandate_desc:0 "The Covid-19 virus hasn’t just gone away because the country has collapsed, if anything it made it worse. We can’t unite our nation if our people are dying from illness in our own backyard. To solve this, we must enforce a vaccine mandate for all of our people, for their own benefit."
 FRA_fund_offshore_wind:0 "Fund Offshore Wind Projects"
 FRA_fund_offshore_wind_desc:0 "America is in desperate need of clean, affordable energy. While we may not have access to vast, empty land to use for renewable energy sources, we do have the ocean. By constructing cutting edge wind turbines on floating platforms, we can generate the energy we need without the pollution."
 FRA_undermine_republicans:0 "Undermine the GOP"
 FRA_undermine_republicans_desc:0 "The Republican remnants in our government have continued to fight us despite the necessity of our actions. If we are going to get anything done, we need to get rid of them. We can’t outright dissolve them, but we can certainly strip them of whatever little scraps of power they cling to."
 FRA_new_age_of_positivity:0 "New Age of Positivity"
 FRA_new_age_of_positivity_desc:0 "Now that we’ve been able to enforce our bright vision for America, the Republicans have started to fall into line and have mellowed out, especially due to the chaos of Trump’s rebellion. Maybe partisan lines don’t have to be so distinct, maybe this is a new age of cooperation for America."
 FRA_codify_roe_v_wade:0 "Codify Roe v. Wade"
 FRA_codify_roe_v_wade_desc:0 "Abortion rights are human rights, and it’s insane that it was ever up for choice. The chaos has given us the opportunity to force this important protection without dealing with bureaucracy. Now, Americans will never have to worry about their reproductive rights ever again."
 FRA_abolish_electoral_college:0 "Abolish the Electoral College"
 FRA_abolish_electoral_college_desc:0 "The electoral college is an outdated system from the era of horse-bound messaging. Compared to the advanced policies of Europe, the college has left us looking like a backwards 18th century country rather than the modern power that we are. We must give the people their voice back, unshackled!"
 FRA_codify_affirmative_action:0 "Codify Affirmative Action"
 FRA_codify_affirmative_action_desc:0 "Affirmative Action has only been a blessing for many minorities in America, and represents the bright future that we seek to build. We cannot let regressive lawmakers strip opportunities and futures from the very people that we week to protect."
 FRA_abolish_filibuster:0 "Abolish Filibuster"
 FRA_abolish_filibuster_desc:0 "Filibusters have historically been the main tool of oppression wielded by the Republican party in order to prevent us from saving Americans. We cannot afford to keep around this outdated system of political harassment and bureaucracy that has done nothing but harm."
 
 FRA_reconciliation:0 "Reassure Republicans"
 FRA_reconciliation_desc:0 "While many Republicans fled west to the lands controlled by Trump, there are still many who stuck around in our government. Uniting America means uniting the people, and that means cooperating with the Republicans. This does make the Progressives in our government unhappy, though, which may be a problem later."
 FRA_federal_republic:0 "The Federal Republic"
 FRA_federal_republic_desc:0 "Many founding fathers of our nation, such as Alexander Hamilton and John Adamns, supported the political movement of Federalism which advocated for a more centralized country. In the wake of America collapsing due to division, we must endeavor to prevent the same feelings of separatism by centralizing."
 FRA_legacy_of_jan_six:0 "Legacy of January 6"
 FRA_legacy_of_jan_six_desc:0 "The January 6th Riots are a dark blot in our nation’s history, and an omen of things to come. We allowed a large portion of our population to become so bitter with our government that they began an assault against the Capital, and we also allowed them to get far enough to get inside of the buildings. Never again can this happen."
 FRA_old_era:0 "Old Era Politics"
 FRA_old_era_desc:0 "The age of the New Deal and bi-partisan cooperation are many decades behind us, but this does not mean that they’re lost to us. If we seek to emulate a time when America was united, then we must emulate the conditions in which this unity was fostered, we must progress backwards, to the old era of the Democrats."
 FRA_meet_with_turtle:0 "Meet with the Turtle"
 FRA_meet_with_turtle_desc:0 "Mitch McConnel has consistently been a thorn in our side. From his efforts to disrupt the Obama administration to his actions under Trump, there are few men alive today who can claim to be a major enemy to the Democratic Party. Nevertheless, he represents a block of Republican voters that we can’t ignore, leaving us with no other choice."
 FRA_protect_freedom_of_speech:0 "Protect the First Amendment"
 FRA_protect_freedom_of_speech_desc:0 "When the Founding Fathers first organized America, they realized that the people needed certain protections, chief among them the ability to speak their mind freely. While some within our government are in favor of curtailing this right, we must reject this notion, as anything like it would betray not only America, but our people."
 FRA_revise_migration_quotas:0 "Revise Migration Quotas"
 FRA_revise_migration_quotas_desc:0 "Immigration has been a hot topic for most of recent American history, and has led to many issues between the Republicans and Democrats. Given how chaotic things are now, and how desperately we need Republican support, we cannot afford to continue our previous standard of immigration acceptance."
 FRA_root_out_corruption:0 "Relearn Compromise"
 FRA_root_out_corruption_desc:0 "For many decades, the American political arena has forgotten something necessary for its continued existence: compromise. The loss of this virtue has caused the state of affairs that we are faced with today. If we truly wish to reunite America, we must do whatever we can to heal the rifts and prevent this from happening again."
 FRA_america_second_to_none:0 "We are America, Second to None!"
 FRA_america_second_to_none_desc:0 "We are America, united as one! No other nation on Earth has ever been as strong or successful as we have. We are a shining beacon of liberty and freedom in a world that seeks to strangle those very ideals. Just because we’re stumbling doesn’t mean we’ve forgotten what that flag means!"
 FRA_loosen_lockdown_regulations:0 "Loosen Lockdown Restricitons"
 FRA_loosen_lockdown_regulations_desc:0 "Maintaining Covid lockdown measures has become costly and counter-productive. We can hardly afford keeping people in their homes and out of work in the name of preventing the spread of a virus. Don’t worry, though, our best medical professionals have confirmed that it would be perfectly safe to let people mingle again."
 FRA_assure_neocons:0 "Approach the Neoconservatives"
 FRA_assure_neocons_desc:0 "The Neoconservatives of the Bush Era have always been opponents of Trumpist politics, with many going as far as to actively support the Democratic party in the national elections. While they have been shrinking in number in recent years, they have potential as a bridge between us and many Republicans."
 FRA_unban_fox_news:0 "Unban Fox News"
 FRA_unban_fox_news_desc:0 "The First Amendment guarantees free speech for everyone. Even if we don’t agree with the things Fox News has been saying, we must respect their right to say it. Allowing them to broadcast in our territory again may cause issues, but it will gain us favor in the Conservative camps."
 FRA_rehabilitate_northeast_fox_assets:0 "Rehabilitate Northeast Fox Assets"
 FRA_rehabilitate_northeast_fox_assets_desc:0 "Just because it’s right to let Fox News say what they want doesn’t mean we can’t change what they want. Some pressure here and some new hires there will allow us to modify the ideology of the news station, at least when it comes to the North-East. The Republicans get their news again, and we get a hold on what they hear, it’s win-win!"
 FRA_attract_astranged_blue_collar_dems:0 "Approach Blue-Collar Democrats"
 FRA_attract_astranged_blue_collar_dems_desc:0 "In the modern era, the Democratic party has been focused on white-collar workers and their progressive leanings. This has left many long-time Democratic voters feeling alienated and disrespected, causing dropping polling numbers in many areas. We need to resolve our relationship with this portion of our voting base."
 FRA_honor_mccain:0 "Honor McCain"
 FRA_honor_mccain_desc:0 "John McCain has always been a friend of the Democratic Party, even if he has tried to run against us and has fought against our policies. He represented a good, moderate Republican who wasn’t afraid to set aside politics in order to help the people. Let him be an example to all of us."
 FRA_reduce_energy_regulations:0 "Reduce Energy Regulations"
 FRA_reduce_energy_regulations_desc:0 "America is in desperate need for energy independence, and the crisis has allowed many to slip into darkness as plants no longer support them. While it makes some of the progressives in our government unhappy, we must reduce the regulations on energy that have been keeping our people in the dark."
 FRA_national_unity_agreement:0 "The National Unity Coalition"
 FRA_national_unity_agreement_desc:0 "A coalition of politicians has been formed with the express purpose of pushing forward national unity policies and projects. We need to mend the rifts between our people, not make them larger, and this is the first step of many towards achieving this goal."
 
 FRA_bidenomics:0 "Creating 'Bidenomics'"
 FRA_bidenomics_desc:0 "Biden has been working on an excellent program that would revitalize America and bring it to the forefront of global trade once again. Dubbed ‘Bidenomics’, he seeks to lessen burdens on average Americans while also strengthening our industrial capability."
 FRA_fed_union_protections:0 "Federal Union Protections"
 FRA_fed_union_protections_desc:0 "Nothing is more American than banding together in order to fight off tyrannical forces. As a result, it’s our duty to protect the labor unions that have been oppressed across America. If the workers of our nation cannot fight for themselves, then how can we claim to be helping them?"
 FRA_chips_act:0 "CHIPs Act"
 FRA_chips_act_desc:0 "The wordily named Creating Helpful Incentives for Producing Semiconductors seeks to help establish an American technological independence from foreign powers, particularly China. It also seeks to bring DEI measures into our technological organizations. Such an initiative would greatly help us recover from the chaos we’re suffering from."
 FRA_raise_minimum_wage_to_15:0 "15$ Minimum Wage"
 FRA_raise_minimum_wage_to_15_desc:0 "For too long, the $7.25 minimum wage has been strangling the futures of our young people. Unlike 50 years ago, they can no longer afford to buy a house and raise a family, stripping the American Dream from many people due to no fault of their own. We must rectify this issue immediately."
 FRA_american_rescue_plan:0 "American Rescue Plan"
 FRA_american_rescue_plan_desc:0 "America is in dire straits, and it needs a proper plan to save it. By injecting large amounts of cash into our nation, and redoubling our efforts in recovery, we can pull our industry and our people out of the dark and into the light of tomorrow."
 FRA_bipartisan_tax_reform:0 "Bipartisan Tax Reform"
 FRA_bipartisan_tax_reform_desc:0 "Our taxes were left in ruin due to the actions of figures such as Trump. All these policies do is make the lives of robber barons easier and the lives of our people harder. We must reform this terrible system if we want to have any hope of lessening the working class’s burdens."
 FRA_stimulus:0 "Stimulus Checks"
 FRA_stimulus_desc:0 "Our economy has been in a rough patch ever since 2008, never truly recovering. The outbreak of civil war has only exacerbated these problems. The people of America are in desperate need of funds just to afford basic necessities. By giving them checks, we can not only inject more cash into the market, but help out our people."
 FRA_forgive_student_loans:0 "Forgive Student Loans"
 FRA_forgive_student_loans_desc:0 "Our youth cannot suffer under debt for the rest of their lives. All that does is strangle them and prevent their growth. A mass forgiving of student loan debts will give many people a breather and give them the chance that they need to achieve great things."
 FRA_inflation_reduction_act:0 "The Inflation Reduction Act"
 FRA_inflation_reduction_act_desc:0 "Inflation has been causing lots of issues for not only America but Americans as individuals. The reckless policy and spending of past presidents has done nothing but cause these issues. Biden seeks to be an outlier by tackling the problem head on and actually giving results to Americans."
 FRA_take_down_traitors:0 "Take Down Traitors"
 FRA_take_down_traitors_desc:0 "America is infested with traitors these days. From the Trumpists and the Bernie-Bros to the west to the Confederates to our south, we’re surrounded. Even in our own territory, the stench of treason is strong. We cannot let these unAmerican cells fester and influence our innocent population."
 FRA_lets_finish_the_job:0 "Lets Finish the Job"
 FRA_lets_finish_the_job_desc:0 "We have been given a mission by America, the mission of restoring the glory of our fine nation and bringing our people into the bright future they deserve. This is our mission and our duty, and it is one we will achieve with pride!"
 FRA_passing_the_torch:0 "Passing the Torch"
 FRA_passing_the_torch_desc:0 "Biden has done the best he could for America, and has done a wonderful job. After lots of discussion, and heavy thinking, he’s come to the opinion that America needs a new face to guide it into the future, not an old one like his. An election will be held, one that will decide the future of Federalist lands and America as a whole."

 FRA_bipartisan_MIC_expansion:0 "Bipartisan Military Industrial Complex Expansion"
 FRA_bipartisan_MIC_expansion_desc:0 "It’s clear that military conflict will have to occur if we want to have any hope of reuniting America. If we want to win, we need to be able to properly support our troops. Thankfully, the military industrial complex is still churning away, and we have a whole continent worth of fuel for it."
 FRA_rejuvinate_pentagon:0 "Modernize the Pentagon"
 FRA_rejuvinate_pentagon_desc:0 "With the state of crisis the Union is in, we must modernize the Pentagon in D.C in order to strengthen our logistics and military. We must show America that we are the ones in control, and we will bring those traitors back into the Union!"

 FRA_bolster_navy_desc:0 "To assert our dominance in the Atlantic and protect vital trade routes, we must strengthen the Eastern American Fleet.

 FRA_expand_naval_academies:0 "Expand Naval Academies"
 FRA_expand_naval_academies_desc:0 "To secure the future of our naval dominance, we must establish new Naval Academies across the country.

 FRA_MIO_contracts:0 "Organize the Military Industrial Complex"
 FRA_MIO_contracts_desc:0 "To ensure the rapid and efficient production of war materials, we must fully integrate and streamline our military-industrial complex.

 FRA_hawkish_revival_desc:0 "Unlike those traitors in the rest of the United States, we were given the mandate by the majority of Americans to govern. We are the democratically elected leaders of the former United States, and we must remain in power. Come on people, give Democracy a Chance!"

 FRA_establishment_entrenched:0 "The Establishment, Entrenched"
 FRA_establishment_entrenched_desc:0 "After much effort, we have firmly embraced the Republicans in our government, uniting the neo-liberal and neo-conservative movements that have slowly been drifting apart since the 80s. Now, the established parties and ideologies of America have a new chance to return normalcy to our country without threat of another disruption like Trump."
 FRA_disregard_the_constitution:0 "Disregard the Constitution"
 FRA_disregard_the_constitution_desc:0 "The Constitution has been around for almost 250 years. While it has been of great help to America in the past, it’s woefully inadequate to face our current reality. In addition to this, it restricts our government from truly helping the American people. So, we must finally lay to rest this great work of America, for the good of the nation."
 FRA_give_us_your_guns:0 "Your Guns. Give them to us."
 FRA_give_us_your_guns_desc:0 "Guns have always been a hot topic in America. For many years, efforts to regulate and restrict these tools of murder have been blocked by law makers across the country. Now, in the wake of the Second American Civil War, keeping tools of war out of the hands of civilians who may fight against peace is more important than ever."
 FRA_militarise_police:0 "Militarise the Police"
 FRA_militarise_police_desc:0 "The Defund the Police movements of the early 2020s have proven to be mistakes. Keeping law and order in our large cities has become more important than even, and rebellious elements threaten our rule across our territory. Using some of our surplus military equipment, we can upgrade the equipment of the police, scarring the cowardly criminals and beating the brave ones."
 FRA_hate_speech_is_not_free_speech:0 "Hate Speech is not Free Speech!"
 FRA_hate_speech_is_not_free_speech_desc:0 "Free speech is an integral part of American democracy, but hate speech has only been working against it. Many people have been allowed to spread terror and fear with their words just because certain lawmakers believed that it was free speech. If we truly want to build a safe America for everyone, we cannot let these people spread their vile hate any longer."
 FRA_even_the_innocent_are_guilty:0 "Even the Innocent are Guilty."
 FRA_even_the_innocent_are_guilty_desc:0 "Hate has an unfortunate history in America, with its roots going so deep into everyday life that many people fail to recognize its signs.

 FRA_illegalise_marijuana:0 "Illegalise Marijuana"
 FRA_illegalise_marijuana_desc:0 "Marijuana has long been thought to be a gateway drug, and a force for societal ruin.

 FRA_absorb_bourbons:0 "Absorb the Bourbon Democrats"

 FRA_alienate_progressives:0 "Alienate the Progressive Democrats"
 FRA_alienate_progressives_desc:0 "The Progressive Democrats have been a source of partisan division for years now. They’re too extreme to cooperate with Republicans, and too extreme even for some Democrats, leading to several losses for their movement. The reality is, if we continue to work with them it’ll only bring us further down, something we cannot afford."
 FRA_listen_to_republicans:0 "Listen to Republicans"
 FRA_listen_to_republicans_desc:0 "We’ve historically alienated Republican voices in government, treating them as an enemy to be denied and destroyed.

 FRA_replace_pelosi:0 "Replace Pelosi"
 FRA_replace_pelosi_desc:0 "Pelosi’s actions in the past have made her a hated figure in Republican circles. Keeping her around would only lead to more issues than it would resolve.

 FRA_district_attourney_desc:0 "Only a few days into her term, and Kamala has already discovered how dire a state we’re in.

We need a strong legal presence to fix this, we need Harris."
 FRA_remove_term_limits:0 "Remove Term Limits"
 FRA_remove_term_limits_desc:0 "Term limits have always been a blight on America. How can we expect anyone to get anything done when in only a handful of years they’ll be out of power?

 FRA_maintain_bop:0 "Maintain the Balance of Power"
 FRA_maintain_bop_desc:0 "The failures of America weren't because of the parties, but because of the people.

 FRA_further_immigration_restrictions:0 "Further Immigration Restrictions"
 FRA_further_immigration_restrictions_desc:0 "Immigration has always been a major issue in America, and a particularly sore spot for Republicans.

 FRA_kamunism_desc:0 "While Communism has historically been an anti-American and anti-democratic force, we cannot deny that it holds useful ideas, especially when it comes to putting down the many rebellions we now face. Under the leadership of our Great Leader Kamala Harris, Communism will be properly democratized and Americanized."
 FRA_temp_suspend_senate_and_house:0 "Suspend the House and Senate"
 FRA_temp_suspend_senate_and_house_desc:0 "Those old fools in the House and Senate have constantly been a thorn in our side.

 FRA_appoint_progressives:0 "Appoint Progressives"
 FRA_appoint_progressives_desc:0 "Now that we’ve cleaned out much of our government of treasonous conservatives, we need someone to fill the positions. Naturally, progressives are perfect for this position. Not only do they have the best for America in mind, they’re also loyal to the President, with some of the younger ones even calling her “Momala” on social media."
 FRA_kamala_constitution:0 "The Kamala Constitution"
 FRA_kamala_constitution_desc:0 "While getting rid of the old constitution has helped us considerably when it comes to restructuring the government, it has led to its own problems.

Thankfully, Kamala has spent many days and nights drafting up the perfect constitution for our new America."

 FRA_americas_attorney_desc:0 "America is doing better than ever! Harris, using her expert legal skills and political know-how, has managed to salvage the Federalist movement from the failures of Biden, and is now set to begin the path towards a united America. Her efforts have ingrained her as one of America’s greatest presidents, and have made her a model to all."

 FRA_justice_shall_be_served_desc:0 "While the North-East has always been treated as a place of high moral and social standards, it’s unfortunate that not everyone meets these expectations.

They’re a cornerstone of American democracy after all! We can, however, make them a few years longer. If the American people can trust them enough to elect them, then surely they can trust them enough to keep them around for longer."

 FRA_the_great_court_reshuffle_desc:0 "The Supreme Court was stuffed with lackeys of Trump during his term, even replacing Ruth Bader Ginsburg with a “moderate” conservative judge.

 FRA_kill_NEW:0 "Destroy Northern Resistance"
 FRA_kill_NEW_desc:0 "Maine was always politically weird. Not only did they maintain a strange position within the Electoral College, which they shared with Nebraska, they also had more Republican support than many New England states, which has risen its ugly voice to pollute our air waves. We cannot allow treasonous propaganda to poison America's birthplace anymore."
 FRA_kill_tim:0 "Invade the Compound"
 FRA_kill_tim_desc:0 "Tim Pool has been stirring up trouble for us for years now. While not the most concerning figure, his alt-lite views have led many good Americans to fall to Republican and alt-right propaganda.

 FRA_retake_virginia:0 "Retake Virginia"
 FRA_retake_virginia_desc:0 "Once the seat of Confederate power, Virginia has become a model state over the years, slowly but surely becoming a land of neo-liberal values.

Instead of throwing good Americans to die against Trumpist forces, we'll conduct training exercises along the border, as well as ensure they become familiar with our defensive lines in the region. We will be the shield of liberty, preserving her glory for the future of all!"
 FRA_strike_first:0 "Strike §RFirst§!"
 FRA_strike_first_desc:0 "This is our moment. If we wait any longer, Trump may gain more steam and any resistance we could muster would be nothing in the face of his alt-right horde.

 FRA_federalist_victory:0 "The Federalist Victory"
 FRA_federalist_victory_desc:0 "The flag of America now flies proudly over Denver once more. The bloody war against the tyranny of Trump and his alt-right Republican followers has ended in the victory of liberty over oppression. Now, we must strive to build back better and bring back life to the scarred land of America. Already, the former states are falling into line with our policies, and the shadow of Trump is being cast out. Never shall we fall, and never shall the light of liberty be stamped out!"

 FRA_expand_obamacare:0 "Expand Obamacare"

 FRA_second_constitutional_convention:0 "A Second Constitutional Convention"
 FRA_second_constitutional_convention_desc:0 "It has become clear that the Constitution of America is outdated and no longer useful to the people of America.

 FRA_nationalize_monopolies_desc:0 "Many corporations have been trying to monopolize things within America, to frightening degrees of success.

 FRA_progressive_republic:0 "A Progressive Republic"
 FRA_progressive_republic_desc:0 "The bright light of Progressivism has finally taken primacy over America.

Never again shall they suffer injustice!"
 FRA_crt:0 "Critical Race Theory"

 FRA_elections:0 "New Elections"
 FRA_elections_desc:0 "Now that America is back to being at least somewhat stable, it’s time to think about the future. While drastic actions may have been taken in the past to secure victory, these policies need to be retracted. In addition, we must think about new elections. Presidents aren’t meant to rule forever, after all."
 FRA_rebuild_infrastructure:0 "Rebuild Infrastructure"

 FRA_slow_disarmament:0 "Slow Disarmament"
 FRA_slow_disarmament_desc:0 "We no longer have a need for masses of armed persons running around the country. While there are still resistance movements to our government, these need to be handled by a proper army, not what we put together for the civil war. A slow but thorough policy of disarmament will allow us to give these heroes back their normalcy."
 FRA_redraw_state_borders:0 "Redraw State Borders"
 FRA_redraw_state_borders_desc:0 "The boundaries of state lines caused lots of trouble during the civil war, particularly in places such as Texas. They’ve allowed regions to develop unified identities separate from America. This, combined with the strange and dated lines, needs to be resolved by redrawing the states."
 FRA_reduce_senatorial_powers:0 "Reduce Senatorial Powers"
 FRA_reduce_senatorial_powers_desc:0 "The Senate has proven to be a source of trouble for our government during the civil war. Their actions at our lowest revealed to us their true colors, and now we know that we must restrict them.

 FRA_unitary_republic_desc:0 "The states and divisions of America were the cause for much of the civil strife.

 FRA_transition_to_corporatism:0 "Transition to Corporatism"
 FRA_transition_to_corporatism_desc:0 "For too long, companies have been held back by nonsensical laws and petty morals. We need to give them the rights that have been denied to them, we need to give them the influence that they earned, we need to give them the power that they deserve."
 FRA_corporate_representation:0 "Give the Companies a Seat in Government"
 FRA_corporate_representation_desc:0 "We’ve already made great efforts in giving the rich and wealthy the place in politics they deserve, it only makes sense that we take the next logical step and grant their corporations a seat at the table.

 FRA_modify_the_bill_of_rights:0 "Amend the Bill of Rights"
 FRA_modify_the_bill_of_rights_desc:0 "The Bill of Rights has long restricted the powers of the government in the inane pursuit of ‘protecting the people’.

 FRA_bolster_american_militarism:0 "Bolster American Militarism"
 FRA_bolster_american_militarism_desc:0 "Just because America is safe, secure, and united does not mean that the future is full of peace. Many powers such as Russia or China have jumped at the opportunity to take advantage of our brief civil war. If we want to have any hope of reestablishing our authority on the world stage, we need a military to back our words up."
 
 FRA_end_isolation:0 "Entering the Fray"

 FRA_international_diplomacy_desc:0 "We left many of our friends in disarray when we collapsed, leaving them open prey for powers such as China or Russia. Now that we are back, however, it is a different story. We must reopen our diplomatic channels and reach out once more to our friends."
 FRA_return_the_favor:0 "Return the Favor"
 FRA_return_the_favor_desc:0 "Trudeau, for all his faults, was a supporter of the Federalist movement since the Second Civil War began.

 FRA_stabalize_mexico:0 "Stabilize Mexico"
 FRA_stabalize_mexico_desc:0 "The collapse of America allowed Mexico to fall into complete chaos. With cartels and communists running rampant, the people of Mexico are surely suffering. We must stabilize Mexico, not only for our own sake, but for the sake of all the people suffering."
 FRA_rebuild_nato:0 "Rebuild NATO"

 FRA_treaty_of_guantanamo_desc:0 "We have tried to allow the Caribbean time to sort itself for as long as we could, but it remains a fact that proper American territory is under foreign occupation.

 FRA_unapologetic_imperialism_desc:0 "For decades, Leftists have called America an imperial power. For once, they were right, only several years early.

 FRA_annex_canada:0 "Annex Canada"
 FRA_annex_canada_desc:0 "Canada has, in reality, simply been confused and lost Americans. Their recent civil war and failure to properly resolve it shows how incapable they are of governing themselves. We must drag Canada into the fold for their own good, and for the good of America."
 FRA_yucatan_gamble:0 "The Yucatan Gamble"
 FRA_yucatan_gamble_desc:0 "In order to achieve total victory in Mexico, the CIA has a proposal to utilize the Yucatan to our own means. Through covert operations, Yucatan will fall before any Mexican official can realize it. Once that happens, Mexico will be practically waiting to be invaded."
 FRA_room_for_one_imperialist:0 "Imperialistic Monroeism"
 FRA_room_for_one_imperialist_desc:0 "The resurgent British Empire in America has lost the humor of the joke it was supposed to be. It’s incredulous that Britain dare reach back across the Atlantic to grab what doesn’t belong to it. Only one empire belongs on North America, and that is us."
 FRA_anglo_american_empire:0 "The Anglo-American Empire"
 FRA_anglo_american_empire_desc:0 "The British are not entirely different from your average American, something cultural sharing has helped facilitate.

 FRA_mexican_intervention:0 "Mexican Intervention"
 FRA_mexican_intervention_desc:0 "Mexico has always been an issue for America, and their civil war has only worsened this. Once, people only came across the border to seek opportunities, now people run across to try and escape the chaos. We cannot let this charade continue.

 FRA_caribbean_intervention:0 "Annex the Caribbean"
 FRA_caribbean_intervention_desc:0 "The Caribbean has been a mess since we left it, though some argue it was a mess before then. Such chaos this close to American interests cannot be permitted to continue, so we must extinguish these rebellions and institute proper order there."

 FRA_mexican_question:0 "Mexican Question"
 FRA_mexican_question_desc:0 "Mexico has always been a divisive subject in America, especially in reactionary circles.

 FRA_no_border_no_crisis:0 "No Border, No Crisis"
 FRA_no_border_no_crisis_desc:0 "Once, Americans questioned if the Mexican border was secure enough, now they question if it was ever an issue to begin with. Without a border, no one can deny Mexicans their basic rights, and no one can make wild claims about immigration."
 FRA_central_american_revolutions:0 "Central American Revolution"
 FRA_central_american_revolutions_desc:0 "Central America, much like the Caribbean, has had its fair share of revolutions and abuse by the American government. While we were unable to prevent those disasters, we are able to prevent future ones by bringing them into our Union."
 FRA_canaadian_revolution:0 "Canadian Revolution"

 FRA_anti_imperialism_desc:0 "Many hard core Marxists in our ranks question our aggressive foreign policy, but it’s clear that they simply don’t understand our purpose.

 FRA_north_american_union_desc:0 "Now that the majority of North America has been liberated, many question if our current name continues to properly represent all Workers, especially given the annexation of Canada.
