 FRA_rebuild_infrastructure:0 "Rebuild Infrastructure"

 FRA_slow_disarmament:0 "Slow Disarmament"
 FRA_slow_disarmament_desc:0 "We no longer have a need for masses of armed persons running around the country. While there are still resistance movements to our government, these need to be handled by a proper army, not what we put together for the civil war. A slow but thorough policy of disarmament will allow us to give these heroes back their normalcy."
 FRA_redraw_state_borders:0 "Redraw State Borders"
 FRA_redraw_state_borders_desc:0 "The boundaries of state lines caused lots of trouble during the civil war, particularly in places such as Texas. They’ve allowed regions to develop unified identities separate from America. This, combined with the strange and dated lines, needs to be resolved by redrawing the states."
 FRA_reduce_senatorial_powers:0 "Reduce Senatorial Powers"
 FRA_reduce_senatorial_powers_desc:0 "The Senate has proven to be a source of trouble for our government during the civil war. Their actions at our lowest revealed to us their true colors, and now we know that we must restrict them.

 FRA_looking_outwards_desc:0 "America is finally on its own two feet again. Once more, we can venture out into the wider world and rejoin the international community.

 FRA_suspend_habeas_corpus:0 "Suspend Free Speech"

 FRA_unitary_republic_desc:0 "The states and divisions of America were the cause for much of the civil strife.

 FRA_transition_to_corporatism:0 "Transition to Corporatism"
 FRA_transition_to_corporatism_desc:0 "For too long, companies have been held back by nonsensical laws and petty morals. We need to give them the rights that have been denied to them, we need to give them the influence that they earned, we need to give them the power that they deserve."
 FRA_corporate_representation:0 "Give the Companies a Seat in Government"
 FRA_corporate_representation_desc:0 "We’ve already made great efforts in giving the rich and wealthy the place in politics they deserve, it only makes sense that we take the next logical step and grant their corporations a seat at the table.

 FRA_modify_the_bill_of_rights:0 "Amend the Bill of Rights"
 FRA_modify_the_bill_of_rights_desc:0 "The Bill of Rights has long restricted the powers of the government in the inane pursuit of ‘protecting the people’.

 FRA_bolster_american_militarism:0 "Bolster American Militarism"
 FRA_bolster_american_militarism_desc:0 "Just because America is safe, secure, and united does not mean that the future is full of peace. Many powers such as Russia or China have jumped at the opportunity to take advantage of our brief civil war. If we want to have any hope of reestablishing our authority on the world stage, we need a military to back our words up."
 
 FRA_end_isolation:0 "Entering the Fray"

 FRA_return_the_favor:0 "Return the Favor"
 FRA_return_the_favor_desc:0 "Trudeau, for all his faults, was a supporter of the Federalist movement since the Second Civil War began. It is unfortunate that he has suffered his own civil war, but he must have hope. America has not forgotten her friends to the north, and thus it is our duty to support Trudeau in his time of need."
 FRA_stabalize_mexico:0 "Stabilize Mexico"
 FRA_stabalize_mexico_desc:0 "The collapse of America allowed Mexico to fall into complete chaos. With cartels and communists running rampant, the people of Mexico are surely suffering. We must stabilize Mexico, not only for our own sake, but for the sake of all the people suffering."
 FRA_rebuild_nato:0 "Rebuild NATO"
 FRA_rebuild_nato_desc:0 "NATO was left severely weakened and useless by the departure of America, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Now that we have restored order in our immediate sphere, we can finally reconnect with NATO and rebuild it to its former glory."

 FRA_treaty_of_guantanamo_desc:0 "We have tried to allow the Caribbean time to sort itself for as long as we could, but it remains a fact that proper American territory is under foreign occupation.

 FRA_annex_canada:0 "Annex Canada"
 FRA_annex_canada_desc:0 "Canada has, in reality, simply been confused and lost Americans. Their recent civil war and failure to properly resolve it shows how incapable they are of governing themselves. We must drag Canada into the fold for their own good, and for the good of America."
 FRA_yucatan_gamble:0 "The Yucatan Gamble"
 FRA_yucatan_gamble_desc:0 "In order to achieve total victory in Mexico, the CIA has a proposal to utilize the Yucatan to our own means. Through covert operations, Yucatan will fall before any Mexican official can realize it. Once that happens, Mexico will be practically waiting to be invaded."
 FRA_room_for_one_imperialist:0 "Imperialistic Monroeism"
 FRA_room_for_one_imperialist_desc:0 "The resurgent British Empire in America has lost the humor of the joke it was supposed to be. It’s incredulous that Britain dare reach back across the Atlantic to grab what doesn’t belong to it. Only one empire belongs on North America, and that is us."
 FRA_anglo_american_empire:0 "The Anglo-American Empire"
 FRA_anglo_american_empire_desc:0 "The British are not entirely different from your average American, something cultural sharing has helped facilitate. Our recent victory over them has given us an opportunity to forge an Anglo-American Empire, but it is clear that it will be an empire of America, not the English."
 FRA_mexican_intervention:0 "Mexican Intervention"
 FRA_mexican_intervention_desc:0 "Mexico has always been an issue for America, and their civil war has only worsened this. Once, people only came across the border to seek opportunities, now people run across to try and escape the chaos. We cannot let this charade continue. Mexico must fall, and in its place the true eagle of North America will fly proud."
 FRA_caribbean_intervention:0 "Annex the Caribbean"
 FRA_caribbean_intervention_desc:0 "The Caribbean has been a mess since we left it, though some argue it was a mess before then. Such chaos this close to American interests cannot be permitted to continue, so we must extinguish these rebellions and institute proper order there."
 FRA_new_banana_republics:0 "New Banana Republics"
 FRA_new_banana_republics_desc:0 "Central America once existed as nothing more than an extension of American interests, and it can be the same once again. Existing solely to supply America with the goods it desires, the Central American states will be made to bend to our will one way or another."

 FRA_assert_american_hegemony_on_the_world_desc:0 "The wings of the American eagle have begun to stretch far and wide.

This is the century of America, and will we do what we please, because no one will dare stop us."
 
 FRA_revolutionary_monroeism:0 "Revolutionary Monroeism"
 FRA_revolutionary_monroeism_desc:0 "The Monroe Doctrine was a great example of the American fight against imperialist forces, though it was too moderate. We can now wield the Monroe Doctrine to its full effect in order to cast down the imperialist powers that want to exploit the Americas."
 FRA_second_caribbean_revolution:0 "A Second Caribbean Spring"
 FRA_second_caribbean_revolution_desc:0 "Once, long ago, the spirit of the revolution burned across the Caribbean, but it was snuffed out by American imperialists. Now, we can atone for our sins and return the red banner to the Caribbean"
 FRA_mexican_question:0 "Mexican Question"
 FRA_mexican_question_desc:0 "Mexico has always been a divisive subject in America, especially in reactionary circles. Its recent civil war and their peoples’ fight for their own rights has made many of us question whether or not it is justifiable to bring them into the Union, or if military force is a necessity."
