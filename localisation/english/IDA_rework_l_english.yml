These plans were referred to by specific colors thus giving them the name of "color-coded war plans." Though the plans were discontinued by the start of World War II, the benefits of making such plans is not lost on our command staff.

 IDA_War_Plan_Brown:0 "War Plan §cBrown§!"
 IDA_War_Plan_Brown_desc:0 "With most of Idaho and Wyoming being under the control of Montana, it only makes sense that it would be one of our first targets. Thus, we have developed War Plan Brown in preparation for our dealings with Montana."    
 IDA_Allies_Up_North:0 "§OAllies§! Up North"
 IDA_Allies_Up_North_desc:0 "It seems Montana has aligned with President Trump, and by extension us. As per our mission objective, we will immediately take control of them for our own use."

 IDA_Lessons_From_The_Big_Sky_Country:0 "Lessons from the Big Sky Country"
 IDA_Lessons_From_The_Big_Sky_Country_desc:0 "The invasion of Montana has proven to be a great learning experience for both our commanders, and our soldiers.

 IDA_War_Plan_Yellow:0 "War Plan §YYellow§!"
 IDA_War_Plan_Yellow_desc:0 "With Utah having derailed our original plans in the first place, it only makes sense we'd take advantage of the chaos south of our border. With this in mind, War Plan Yellow has been devised with the goal of subjugating the entire southwest through any means necessary."
 IDA_Support_The_Mormons:0 "Support the §BMo§!rmo§Bns§!"
 IDA_Support_The_Mormons_desc:0 "Despite being the ones to betray us, the LDS Church is a much more reliable ally than a ragtag group of criminals and secessionists. With that said, it would be advantageous for us to support Utah in it's war against the Freedom Coalition. For if they win, they may just come running back to us after all."
 IDA_Support_The_Freedom_Coalition:0 "Support the §GFr§!§Yeed§!§Gom§! §YCoa§!§Glit§!§Yion§!" 
 IDA_Support_The_Freedom_Coalition_desc:0 "Though backing the Freedom Coalition may be a questionable move (considering a good portion of them are convicted criminals) there are some valid reasons in doing do.

 IDA_Direct_Intervention:0 "Direct §RIntervention§!"
 IDA_Direct_Intervention_desc:0 "Though we were satisfied with observing the war from the sidelines, it has dragged on for far too long, and we can't afford to wait any longer.

 IDA_Allies_Down_South:0 "§OAllies§! Down South"
 IDA_Allies_Down_South_desc:0 "Through an unexpected turn of events, Utah has returned to having a Trumpist-aligned government. We must take full advantage of this situation, and ask them to rejoin our faction. Though there's no guarantee they'll join us, the least we can do is try."
 IDA_Operation_Beekeeper:0 "Operation §YBee§!§gkee§!§Yper§!"
 IDA_Operation_Beekeeper_desc:0 "Though they were successful in their war against the Freedom Coalition, it appears Utah has truly abandoned President Trump and his cause. As such, it is our duty to reel them back into our domain, and secure Utah once and for all."
 IDA_Operation_Prometheus:0 "Operation §RPro§!§Ometh§!§Yeus§!"
 IDA_Operation_Prometheus_desc:0 "With the Freedom Coalition having come out victorious against Utah, we must make our move to secure our position as soon as possible. The plan is simple, punch through to Salt Lake CIty on I-15 and I-80 before fanning out from there. We've already come this far, a ragtag group of escaped convicts won't stop us now."
 IDA_Unexpected_Allies:0 "Unexpected §OAllies§!"
 IDA_Unexpected_Allies_desc:0 "With their victory over Utah, no one expected the members of the Freedom Coalition to turn to President Trump for support, but now they have. This unprecedented move has allowed us the opportunity to ask them to join us in our crusade to reunite the west. Though we can't guarantee they'll actually join us, there's no harm in trying."
 IDA_Utahn_Military_Advisors:0 "Utahn Military Advisors"
 IDA_Utahn_Military_Advisors_desc:0 "With our (mostly) peaceful pacification of the southwest, we can now reap the rewards it entails. One of these rewards is access to Utah's military staff, and training facilities. With these, we can progress further in our goal to professionalize our army."

 IDA_Industry_Of_The_Beehive_State_desc:0 "Our domination over the southwest has given us access to a bountiful amount of industry of five different states. This massive boost to our economy will, in no doubt, further our progress towards economic independence from the east."

 IDA_Masters_Of_The_Rockies_desc:0 "Through our hard work and a few strokes of luck, we have managed to take control over the Mountain West.

 IDA_To_Dominate_The_Skies:0 "To §gDominate§! the §CSkies§!"
 IDA_To_Dominate_The_Skies_desc:0 "A sufficient air force is one of the crucial pieces of a modern army. Though we lacked the resources to improve our air force earlier, with our newfound wealth, improving our air force has become a top priority. With the first priority of any air force being to dominate the skies while denying your opponents the same access, it is only sensible we work on improving our air superiority capabilities first."
 IDA_A_Question_Of_Doctrine:0 "A Question of Doctrine"
 IDA_A_Question_Of_Doctrine_desc:0 "Though we've got to work on securing the skies, we must decide on a doctrine before we proceed any further. We have two options before us, we can focus on strategic bombing, crippling the industry of our foes; we can focus on battlefield support; raining fire from the skies; or we can try doing a bit of both." 
 IDA_Bolster_Aircraft_Production:0 "Bolster Aircraft §GProduction§!"

 IDA_Reinstate_Air_Force_Generals_desc:0 "When the Western Command Zone was first established, all generals of the Wyoming and Idaho National Guard were discharged in a move to endure loyalty to President Trump. Now, with our position secure, we have begun the process of reinstating generals of the Air National Guard. This move will allow us to draw on much needed talent, while maintaining the current political situation."  
 IDA_Contract_Flight_Training_Companies:0 "Contract Flight Training Companies"
 IDA_Contract_Flight_Training_Companies_desc:0 "With our ever-growing need to train pilots, we have found an unlikely solution to our issue, private companies. Various private companies at home, and abroad, offer private air services, and training, to anyone willing to pay the price. With our newfound wealth in the Rockies, we should take advantage of these offers while they're available to us."
 IDA_Eagles_Of_The_West:0 "§REagles§! of the §BWest§!"
 IDA_Eagles_Of_The_West_desc:0 "We've come a long way since the beginnings of our air force.

Now, it is time we take our position among the skies with the rest of our peers, a vanguard for freedom in the west." 
 # War Plan Orange #
 IDA_War_Plan_Orange:0 "War Plan §OOrange§!"
 IDA_War_Plan_Orange_desc:0 "The current situation in Cascadia is one that can greatly benefit us. They are politically isolated, having split off from California shortly before the Good Friday agreement, and there is much discontent between the heavily conservative populations of the east, and the liberal populations of the coast. This isolation and instability make Cascadia a prime target for us, and we must act quick if we are to catch them off guard."
 IDA_Work_With_Shea:0 "§CWork§! with §pShea§!"
 IDA_Work_With_Shea_desc:0 "Matt Shea, and the state of Liberty overall, represent the frustrations rural conservatives have living under the boot of liberal urbanites. This makes them the perfect allies to reach out for support in fighting Cascadia."
 IDA_Operation_Inquisition:0 "Operation §RInquisition§!"
 IDA_Operation_Inquisition_desc:0 "Despite their populous' conservative views, the state of Liberty has fallen to the rule of extremists. As such, working with them is completely out of the question, and our only business with them is to liberate their repressed populations."
 IDA_Operation_Evergreen:0 "Operation §GEvergreen§!"
 IDA_Operation_Evergreen_desc:0 "With Liberty having been dealt with, we can now turn our attention to the real prize, Cascadia. The plan is simple, we'll follow I-84 and I-90 west, and drive our way to the strongholds of Portland and Seattle. Cascadia will be ours!." 
 IDA_Proclaim_Shea_As_Governor_Of_Cascadia:0 "Proclaim §pShea§! as Governor of §GCascadia§!"
 IDA_Proclaim_Shea_As_Governor_Of_Cascadia_desc:0 "The loyalty shown to us by Matt Shea and the people of Liberty has not gone unnoticed.

 # War Plan White #
 IDA_War_Plan_White:0 "War Plan White"
 IDA_War_Plan_White_desc:0 "With our goals nearly in sight, only one obstacle really stands in our way, the Democrat bastion of California. Most of our troops have been planning for an invasion from California for nearly a decade, and now here we are, right at the doorstep of The Golden State, ready to settle it once and for al."
 IDA_Operation_Wolverine:0 "Operation §RWolverine§!"
 IDA_Operation_Wolverine_desc:0 "California: the socialist bastion, the land of liberals, the place where "conservative" Republicans betrayed President Trump for a dictator. Now, our troops stand at their doorstep, poised to reclaim the land President Reagan once called, "The place where good Republicans go to die.""
 IDA_Meet_With_Jenner:0 "Meet with §OJenner§!"
 IDA_Meet_With_Jenner_desc:0 "To the absolute shock of every American, California has declared its loyalty to President Trump, and the Trumpist cause. The one behind this, celebrity turned politician, Caitlyn Jenner, now wields a considerable amount of power, and if we are to satisfy President Trump's demands, we must negotiate with them."  
 IDA_Integrate_California:0 "Integrate §YCalifornia§!"
 IDA_Integrate_California_desc:0 "With our conquest of California, we must now get to work on integrating our new found territories. Though the large liberal populations of Los Angeles and the Bay Area might give us some trouble, many Californians are die-hard conservatives, making our job just a bit easier."
 IDA_Reopen_Californian_Univeristies:0 "Reopen Californian Universities"
 IDA_Reopen_Californian_Univeristies_desc:0 "Despite their reputation for turning our radical socialists, Californian universities remain some of the best in the country, and the research they conduct is invaluable.

 IDA_War_Plan_Indigo:0 "War Plan §pIndigo§!"
 IDA_War_Plan_Indigo_desc:0 "War Plan Indigo deals with the U.S. Pacific Fleet (or whatever is left with it,) and in particular, Hawaii and Alaska. Being removed from the continental United States, makes these areas significantly hard to invade, especially taking into account our lack of a proper navy. However, this will not deter us, and we'll bring them back into the fold one way or another." 
 ## Defensive Path ##
 IDA_Dig_In:0 "Dig §CIn§!"
 IDA_Dig_In_desc:0 "We have decided to postpone our goal to reunite the western U.S., and focus on fortifying our position instead. With no immediate goals ahead of us, we can turn our attention towards reforming our state in preparation for the future."

 idaho_rework.53.t:0 "Utah Requests the Return of Logan"

 idaho_rework.55.d:0 "Following our request to have northern Utah returned to us, the Western Command Zone gave us a counter-proposal, to trade Logan and Moffat County for all of our Nevadan territories. This counter-offer is an outrageous demand, considering how much more territory we'd be giving up. Alas, if we wish to resolve this situation peacefully, this may be an offer we just have to take."
 idaho_rework.55.a:0 "Better to keep the peace for now, we'll accept their offer."
 idaho_rework.55.b:0 "We'll accept the offer...on the condition we get to keep Vegas."

 idaho_rework.56.d:0 "We've received word that the Utahns are willing to accept our counter-offer on one condition, they get to keep Las Vegas. With Vegas being the most developed region in Nevada by a long shot, their request tips heavily in their favor. That said, we'd still gain control over most of Nevada at little cost to us, and the benefits of resolving this conflict peacefully may outweigh the loss of Clark County."
 idaho_rework.56.a:0 "They can keep it. We didn't want that liberal, hellhole anyway."

 idaho_rework.61.d:0 "Jeff Stankiewicz walked down the line of troops, standing at attention, waiting to be inspected. Just a little while ago, these troops were a ragtag fighting force of day laborers, retirees, and veterans who barely knew how to operate a tank. Now they were a professional army, well versed in the art of modern war, and comparable to their contemporaries. Stankiewicz felt proud, they had come a long way from their militia roots, and they were going to keep moving forward. They were now going to take on the socialist menace in the west, and Stankiewicz was confident that these boys could do the job."

 idaho_rework.62.d:0 "To the shock of many observers, militias loyal to Donald Trump have managed to secure their hold over the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. This victory has deeply emboldened the Trump administration in their quest to reclaim the U.S., while the Biden administration has remained silent on the matter. The militias are expected to push their expansion westward into the Pacific states, but only time will tell whether they can replicate their success against the Californian juggernaut that awaits them."

The Bundys are arguably the most well connected militia leaders in the entire U.S., and the support they can provide is immeasurable. However, it should be noted that these connections also make them incredibly influential in our political sphere, and there is concern that their loyalty to President Trump is shaky at best. How should we respond to their offer?"
 idaho_rework.64.a:0 "This is a good deal, despite the downsides."

 idaho_rework.67.d:0 "As we had been preparing to reinstate some generals of the Air National Guard to help with the improvement of our air force, an old problem has come back to bite us in the butt. Generals from the Idaho and Wyoming Army National Guard managed to catch wind of our plans, and have demanded they be reinstated as well. Though our success has drained much of the influence they used to have, their demand isn't entirely useless to us. Unlike most of our commanders, these generals have had years of experience as officers, and were still in active duty when the civil war began, making them some of the best commanders available to us. That said, giving in to their demands like this will make us appear weak, and cost us politically. Should we accept their demands?"
 idaho_rework.67.a:0 "We're sticking to the original plan."

 idaho_rework.68.d:0 "The story of our air force has been incredibly similar to that of our army. We began with a small, insufficient force, and through a series of trials and tribulations, we've managed to obtain a competent, professional force. Of course, unlike with our army, we could afford to improve our air force without having to resort to learning from experience, but nevertheless, we now have access to an air force that can match our opponents in the skies.\n\nOur days of hunkering down during aerial bombardment is over."

Though this response could have easily been a justified reason to go to conquer California, President Trump has strongly alluded to extreme disapproval of us getting into a war such an important ally. As such, we'll have to drop the matter, and leave it for another time."
 idaho_rework.77.a:0 "A disastrous response, but we'll make do with what we have."
 idaho_rework.78.t:0 "The [IDA.GetName] to Merge with Us."
 idaho_rework.78.d:0 "Completely out of the blue, the [IDA.GetName] has asked they be integrated into the Californian Command, citing the completion of their mission should we agree. Of course, we have no reason to refuse their offer, but even still, it's still completely shocking they would submit themselves to us, so simply."
 idaho_rework.78.a:0 "An unexpected surprise, but a welcome one."
 idaho_rework.79.t:0 "The [IDA.GetName] Requests We Join Them"
 idaho_rework.79.d:0 "A little while ago, we got an offer from the {IDA.GetName] to join them in their mission to reunify the western U.S. By this point, its just a matter of who do we want to support first. We can help the [IDA.GetName] and help them with the last stretch of their mission, or we can focus our attention to helping President Trump in the east."
 idaho_rework.79.a:0 "We're in no rush, we will help them."
 idaho_rework.79.b:0 "Our attention is demanded in the east, they can handle themselves."

 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 DESC_LEADER_JEFF_STANKIEWICZ:0 "Hailing from Priest River, Idaho, Jeffery Stankiewicz was a welder and production supervisor in his professional life. After experiencing a period of unemployment in 2010, Stankiewicz founded the Idaho Light Foot Militia (ILFM) under the justification that Democrats were attempting to install a socialist dictatorship. Though he was reemployed by the start of 2011, Stankiewicz continued to lead, and expand, the ILFM, something that would prove vital in the coming decade."      
 DESC_LEADER_GARY_L_SAYLER:0 "Gary L. Sayler has had a rather successful career in the military. Hailing from the U.S. Air Force, Sayler was initially the commander of the 124th Wing at Gowen Field in Boise, Idaho from 1995 to 2004. Sayler would later become the Commander of Idaho's National Air Guard's Joint Force at Gowen Field until 2010 when he was appointed as Idaho's adjutant general, a position he held until 2017." 
 DESC_LEADER_SUSAN_GORE:0 "The daughter of W. L. Gore & Associates co-founder, Wilbert Lee 'Bill' Gore, Susan Gore became infamous for using her family fortune to conduct espionage against political opponents in Wyoming."   
 DESC_LEADER_MELISSA_SUE_ROBINSON:0 "A transgender woman and advocate, Melissa Sue Robinson attempted to run for public office in Nampa, Idaho several times, but has been unsuccessful every single time. She had planned to run in the 2022 Idaho gubernatorial election, but the start of the civil war derailed those plans."
 DESC_LEADER_NATE_MARTIN:0 "Born and raised in Rock Springs, Wyoming, Nate Martin was a writer who worked in the industry for over 15 years. Aside from that, he has been the executive director of the activist group, Better Wyoming since 2017, and served as a trustee on the Albany County School Board."
 DESC_LEADER_JOHN_EARLE_SULLIVAN:0 "If there is one thing that can be said about John Earle Sullivan, it is that he is an extremely militant, black rights activist from Utah. Aside from that, Sullivan has been accused of being both an agent for the left and the right, giving him a rather notorious reputation among the activist community."   
 DESC_LEADER_CHUCK_BALDWIN:0 "Chuck Baldwin is a pastor from Kalispell, Montana, and former chaplain for the Montanan Oath Keepers. Before his move to Montana, Baldwin was the founder, and pastor, of the Crossroad Baptist Church in Pensacola, Florida. From there, Baldwin would have a long history at attempted political campaigns in 2004, 2008, and 2012 for both the Constitution and American Independent Party."
 DESC_LEADER_BRAD_LITTLE:0 "Before becoming governor of Idaho, Brad Little had an extensive dual career as a rancher, and as a politician. As a politician, Little was a state senator who served on several agricultural, environmental, and economic committees, before becoming lieutenant governor of Idaho in 2009, and governor of Idaho in 2019. When the civil war kicked off, Idaho’s poor showing against Montana led to a leadership crisis as lieutenant governor Janice McGeachin attempted to seize power, but this was aborted with the formation of the Western Command Zone."
 DESC_LEADER_JANICE_MCGEACHIN:0 ""A member of the more right-wing faction of the Republican Party, Janice McGeachin has been in politics since 1998, having been a member of the Idaho House of Representatives. As lieutenant governor, McGeachin has been incredibly critical of governor Brad Little, and Idaho’s poor performance against Montana, in the early days of the civil war, led to her attempting to remove Little from power."
 DESC_LEADER_MARK_GORDON:0 "Holding a Bachelor of Arts degree in history, Mark Gordon, to say the least, has had a rather lackluster career in politics. After a failed congressional run in 2008, he would eventually be elected as Treasurer of Wyoming, serving from 2012 to 2019. Gordon would assume the office of governor of Wyoming in 2019, and is most notable for having proposed $500 million worth of cuts to Wyoming's budget to account for declining revenues."
 DESC_LEADER_AMMON_BUNDY:0 "A leading figure in the American militia movement, Ammon Bundy was born, and raised, on his father's ranch in Bunkerville, Nevada before moving out, and having a troubled, professional career in Phoenix, Arizona before eventually settling in Emmett, Idaho./n/nAway from his personal life, Bundy would truly make a name for himself in 2014, where he helped organize the 2014 Bundy Standoff, where his father clashed with the Bureau of Land Management over grazing rights, eventually prevailing when BLM withdrew from the situation. This success would later prompt him to organize the disastrous 2016 Occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge to protest the treatment of two ranchers convicted of federal land arson. The standoff would end with the death of one militia member, and arrest of all other participants, most of whom would be sentenced and sent to prison for their actions. Bundy, however, would manage to be found not-guilty on all accounts, and later continue to advocate against the government until the start of the 2nd American Civil War./n/nWhen the civil war began, Bundy would lend his support to his native Idaho against the pro-Biden forces of Montana. Once the dust settled, and a temporary ceasefire was enacted Bundy would remain in the now, newly established Western Command Zone until hearing rumors of a potential LDS coup in the near future. Being a devote member of the LDS Church, Bundy would travel down to Utah, to offer his support to the church in preparation for their potential coup."   
 # Advisor Descriptions #
 DESC_ADVISOR_JAMES_WESLEY_RAWLES:0 "A self-described Christian Constitutionalist, James Wesley, Rawles is a survival blogger living on a ranch in an undisclosed location (believed to be Stites, Idaho.) Despite his supposed location having been overrun by Montanan forces, Rawles continues to update his blog with advice on how to survive in these troubling times."
 DESC_ADVISOR_MIKE_ADAMS:0 ""Having claimed to have cured himself of type II diabetes when he was 30, Mike Adams is the founder and owner of conspiracy theory and pseudoscience site, Natural News.

Of course, he is best known for his role in the 2012 Battle of Benghazi, where he (and other security contractors) helped defend a U.S. compound from Islamic militants."
 DESC_GENERAL_ERIC_MOUTSOS:0 "A former officer of the Salt Lake Police Department, Eric Moutsos resigned from his job after being suspended for refusing to participate in the 2014 Utah Pride Parade, citing religious reasons. After his resignation, Moutsos would become an advocate, working as Manager of Development for the conservative think-tank, Sutherland Institute. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, Moutsos protested vigorously against government mandates."
 DESC_GENERAL_BOONE_TIDWELL:0 "Boone Tidwell had a long career before the start of the civil war.

Tidwell launched an unsuccessful campaign to become Park County Commissioner in 2016, and helped establish a group to protect Cody residents from rioters in 2020." 
 DESC_GENERAL_ERIC_PARKER:0 "Making a name for himself as the "Bundy Ranch Sniper," Eric Parker could be considered one of the more "inexperienced" commanders of the Western Command Zone due to being an electrician by trade, as well as having no experience in military or law enforcement. In 2018, Parker split the 'Real 3%ers of Idaho' off from the main Idaho branch of the 3%ers, and ran an unsuccessful campaign to become an Idaho state senator in 2020."
