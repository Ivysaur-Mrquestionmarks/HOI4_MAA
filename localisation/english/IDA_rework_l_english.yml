This unprecedented move has allowed us the opportunity to ask them to join us in our crusade to reunite the west. Though we can't guarantee they'll actually join us, there's no harm in trying."

 IDA_Restoring_Order:0 "Restoring Order"
 IDA_Restoring_Order_desc:0 "It is high time we turned our attention to putting down the rampant lawlessness within our borders. Luckily for us, these petty criminals are no match for our troops, and this matter should be dealt with shortly."
 IDA_American_Redoubt:0 "The American Redoubt"
 IDA_American_Redoubt_desc:0 "Proposed by our very own James Wesley, Rawles back in 2011, the American Redoubt was intended to be a safe haven for God-fearing conservatives in the northwestern United States, with the idea being that people would migrate to the area over time. Though we have lost much of the land comprising the borders of the original redoubt, many continue to arrive in our territory under the guise of supporting us."
 IDA_Militia_State_1:0 "Militia State"
 IDA_Militia_State_1_desc:0 "Being a state reliant on militias is a mixed bag. Though we enjoy a network of local connections and great knowledge of local geography, our pilots can't fly anything faster than a propeller plane, our soldiers can't handle most heavy weapon systems properly, and operating a proper tank is a pipe dream. Our forces are thoroughly unprepared to fight a modern war, and the sidelining of military officers has only exacerbated this problem. It will take a monumental effort if we are to build a professional fighting force.\n§T----------------§!\n§YThe state of our army will improve with successful wars against our neighbors, but we can still make efforts to reform our forces in the meantime.§!"

Waging a successful war now, should inspire greater enlistment, and slightly improve the state of our army.§!"

 IDA_Militia_State_3_desc:0 "We have decided to use what little, political will we have to encourage enlistment into our army. Though this doesn't help with the quality of our armed forces, it will help alleviate our dire manpower shortage.\n§T----------------§!\n§YWe have chosen to forgo improving the quality of our army in exchange for alleviating our manpower issues. Waging a successful war now, will return enlistment levels back to normal rates, but greatly improve the state of our army.§!" 
 IDA_Militia_State_4:0 "Militia State - Partially Reformed"

 IDA_Economic_Dependence_1:0 "Dependent Industry"
 IDA_Economic_Dependence_1_desc:0 "The loss of much of our territory in Idaho and Wyoming has also resulted in the loss of our industrial capacity.

 IDA_Economic_Dependence_2:0 "Dependent Industry - Increased Taxation"
 IDA_Economic_Dependence_2_desc:0 "Though it goes against some of our core beliefs, we have had no choice, but to increase taxes in order to fund basic government functions.

 idaho_rework.2.d:0 "Out of all the things Stankiewicz thought he'd be doing when given control of the Western Command Zone, spending hours tucked behind a desk wasn't one of them. Though this type of work wasn't foreign to him (having been a production manager before the war) the sheer amount of paperwork that had to be done was absurd. Stankiewicz leaned back in his chair, he could use a nap, and it wasn't like the reports on his desk would be going anywhere. As he closed his eyes a secretary burst through the door. "Sir," the secretary said frantically, "you have a call coming in from Denver."\n\n"Is it the president?" replied a tired Stankiewicz.\n\n"Yes, sir."\n\n"Hand me the phone."\n\nThe secretary handed Stankiewicz the phone and he placed it up to his ear, sure enough, it was president Trump.\n\nStankiewicz shot up, "Mr. President," he said firmly.\n\nA familiar voice bellowed from the other end, "Commander Stankiewicz, how have you been doing?"\n\n"I've..." Stankiewicz paused for a moment, "been doing fine sir, and you?"\n\n"I've seen better days Stankiewicz, Pence and his traitorous entourage and what not," the president began trailing off before jumping back on topic. "Enough of that squabble, Stankiewicz, I have a job for you."\n\n"What is it sir?"\n\n"I want you to get your forces mobilized ASAP, and begin prepping for an invasion of Montana. My advisors have been telling me Bullock's in a tight spot right now, and now's the time to strike. Am I clear, commander?"\n\nA brief pause came and went before Stankiewicz replied, "Yes sir, I'll send out the mobilization order immediately."\n\n"Good..good..don't let me down commander, this country is depending on you."\n\n"Yes sir, you won't be disappointed.§!"\n\nThe phone hung up, and the secretary approached Stankiewicz, "Would you like me to send out the order sir?"\n\n"Yeah, go do that," Stankiewicz replied, "and get me a coffee as well, I have a feeling I'm going to need it."\n\n"As you wish sir."\n\nThe secretary exited the room, and Stankiewicz looked down at his desk. This was going to be a long day."

 idaho_rework.54.a:0 "It seems our gambit payed off."
 idaho_rework.55.t:0 "The Western Command Zone Offers a Trade"
 idaho_rework.55.d:0 "Following our request to have northern Utah returned to us, the Western Command Zone gave us a counter-proposal, to trade Logan and Moffat County for all of our Nevadan territories. This counter-offer is an outrageous demand, considering how much more territory we'd be giving up. Alas, if we wish to resolve this situation peacefully, this may be an offer we just have to take."
 idaho_rework.55.a:0 "Better to keep the peace for now, we'll accept their offer."
 idaho_rework.55.b:0 "We'll accept the offer...on the condition we get to keep Vegas."
 idaho_rework.55.c:0 "An outlandish demand deserves an outrageous answer. No!"
 idaho_rework.56.t:0 "Utah Requests to Keep Vegas"
 idaho_rework.56.d:0 "We've received word that the Utahns are willing to accept our counter-offer on one condition, they get to keep Las Vegas. With Vegas being the most developed region in Nevada by a long shot, their request tips heavily in their favor. That said, we'd still gain control over most of Nevada at little cost to us, and the benefits of resolving this conflict peacefully may outweigh the loss of Clark County."
 idaho_rework.56.a:0 "They can keep it. We didn't want that liberal, hellhole anyway."
 idaho_rework.56.b:0 "We said §RALL§! of Nevada, so we'll get §RALL§! of Nevada."
 idaho_rework.57.t:0 "Utah Rejects Our Offer!"
 idaho_rework.57.d:0 "The Utahn government has rejected our offer, and with it, any hope of a peaceful resolution between our two states. If we are to achieve our goals of reuniting the west in a timely manner, we must take action immediately."  
 idaho_rework.57.a:0 "We'll see who's the real master of the Rockies."
 idaho_rework.58.t:0 "The [IDA.GetName] Requests we Join Their Faction"
 idaho_rework.58.d:0 "With our recent flip towards the Trumpists, it was only a matter of time until the [IDA.GetName] asked we join them in their quest to reunite the west. Should we join them, we will temporarily abandon our eastern commitments to help unify the west. Should we refuse, we will remain committed to more eastern affairs. What should we do?"
 idaho_rework.58.a:0 "We'll gladly join them."
 idaho_rework.58.b:0 "We're comfortable with our current arrangement."
 idaho_rework.59.t:0 "[From.GetName] has Decided to Join Us"
 idaho_rework.59.d:0 "We've received word that [From.GetName] has agreed to help us unify the west coast. Their support is more than welcome, and the help they'll provide will be incredibly helpful in the near future." 
 idaho_rework.59.a:0 "Welcome to the team."
 idaho_rework.60.t:0 "[From.GetName] has Refused to Join Us"
 idaho_rework.60.d:0 "We've received word that [From.GetName] has refused to aid us in our mission to unify the west coast. Though it's sad we won't have their support, there's not much we can do about it now."
 idaho_rework.60.a:0 "We'll make do with what we have."

After experiencing a period of unemployment in 2010, Stankiewicz founded the Idaho Light Foot Militia (ILFM) under the justification that Democrats were attempting to install a socialist dictatorship. Though he was reemployed by the start of 2011, Stankiewicz continued to lead, and expand, the ILFM, something that would prove vital in the coming decade."      
 DESC_LEADER_GARY_L_SAYLER:0 "Gary L. Sayler has had a rather successful career in the military. Hailing from the U.S. Air Force, Sayler was initially the commander of the 124th Wing at Gowen Field in Boise, Idaho from 1995 to 2004.

 DESC_LEADER_JOHN_EARLE_SULLIVAN:0 "If there is one thing that can be said about John Earle Sullivan, it is that he is an extremely militant, black rights activist from Utah.

 DESC_LEADER_CHUCK_BALDWIN:0 "Chuck Baldwin is a pastor from Kalispell, Montana, and former chaplain for the Montanan Oath Keepers. Before his move to Montana, Baldwin was the founder, and pastor, of the Crossroad Baptist Church in Pensacola, Florida.

As a politician, Little was a state senator who served on several agricultural, environmental, and economic committees, before becoming lieutenant governor of Idaho in 2009, and governor of Idaho in 2019. When the civil war kicked off, Idaho’s poor showing against Montana led to a leadership crisis as lieutenant governor Janice McGeachin attempted to seize power, but this was aborted with the formation of the Western Command Zone."

 DESC_LEADER_MARK_GORDON:0 "Holding a Bachelor of Arts degree in history, Mark Gordon, to say the least, has had a rather lackluster career in politics.

Gordon would assume the office of governor of Wyoming in 2019, and is most notable for having proposed $500 million worth of cuts to Wyoming's budget to account for declining revenues."
