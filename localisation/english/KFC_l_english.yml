 kentucky.1.t:0 "The Rebellion"
 kentucky.1.d:0 "The time has come to oust the Colonel's vile armies and destroy his perverted vision of a degraded Kentucky."
 kentucky.1.a:0 "Kentucky, Rise!"
 kentucky.2.t:0 "Beginning of the Continental Congress"
 kentucky.2.d:0 "With the Colonel ousted, the time has come to hold a grand congress on the future of Kentucky!"
 kentucky.2.a:0 "Three Cheers for Kentucky!"
 kentucky.3.t:0 "Tea Party Celebrations"
 kentucky.3.d:0 "The Tea Party has held state-wide celebrations for the successful revolution, they are very popular."
 kentucky.3.a:0 "You haven't even been elected yet!"
 kentucky.4.t:0 "Liberals demand TWP exclusion from the Congress"
 kentucky.4.d:0 "The Liberals participating in the Continental Congress are demanding that the Traditional Workers Party be excluded from the Congress due to their more authoritarian and supremacist nature.\n\nMatthew Parrott has blasted Fischer's liberals, calling them hypocrites and "just as bad as The Colonel"."
 kentucky.4.a:0 "Here we go..."
 kentucky.5.t:0 "The Tea Party defends the TWP"
 kentucky.5.d:0 "Though making absolutely clear that they do not align in the slightest with the Traditional Workers Party, the Tea Party has stood in their defence saying that they have every right to participate in the Congress. Indeed, Matt Bevin points out that the rebellion may not have even been possible let alone successful without the support of the TWP stormtroopers."
 kentucky.5.a:0 "Who will win the debate?"
 kentucky.6.t:0 "TWP holds rallies against the Liberals"
 kentucky.6.d:0 "In response to the Liberal demand for TWP exclusion, the TWP has held rallies across Kentucky protesting the demand. \n\n"The IRONY!" Matt Parrott was heard shouting. "These so-called defenders of democracy want to ban us from participating in it! Just like the Colonel!""
 kentucky.6.a:0 "I think I can see where this is going..."
 kentucky.7.t:0 "TWP Rallies turn violent"
 kentucky.7.d:0 "The Tradtional Workers Party rallies have begun turning into riots, as members begin firebombing stores and looting, while left-wing militants agitate and counterprotest. Both sides blame each other for the incidents, and it only feels like it will get worse."
 kentucky.7.a:0 "Not another Charlottesville..."
 kentucky.8.t:0 "Congress Bans the Traditional Workers Party"
 kentucky.8.d:0 "In the wake of the violent rallies held by the TWP, the right wing of the Congress has found themselves unable to defend the party anymore and the Liberal motion to ban the TWP from participation has passed."
 kentucky.8.a:0 "Parrott must be livid."
 kentucky.9.t:0 "Parrott protests the ban"
 kentucky.9.d:0 "Using buzzwords such as "unconstitutional" and "undemocratic", Matthew Parrott has blasted the Continental Congress following the ban of his party, the Traditional Workers Party. His supporters are becoming more militant and fervent."
 kentucky.9.a:0 "He doesn't matter anymore."
 kentucky.10.t:0 "Traditional Workers Party storms the Congress"
 kentucky.10.d:0 "Following the ban of the TWP from the Continental Congress, their violent activities only multiplied in both scale and nature. During a particularly large rally, members of the TWP storm the Continental Congress in scenes not entirely dissimilar from what happened in D.C. on January 6th 2021."
 kentucky.10.a:0 "The Security Forces successfully beat back the violent protestors"
 kentucky.10.b:0 "Parrott is sneaked in and lets the rioters in"
 kentucky.11.t:0 "Election Day"
 kentucky.11.d:0 "With the Traditional Workers Party now in tatters following the failed coup, and their members being actively persecuted by the full extent of the law, the time has come to decide Kentucky's future. Greg Fischer rallies his former democrats, now organised as the Labor Party, while Matt Bevin is given formal leadership of the Tea Party."
 kentucky.11.a:0 "The Tea Party!"
 kentucky.11.b:0 "The Labor Party!"
 kentucky.12.t:0"A Finger Lickin Good Deal"
 kentucky.12.d:0"The Kentucky Civil War is perhaps one of the first proper proxy wars in North America. There are troops supported by Trump's government, Biden's government and us as well. While it is clear that a Trump backed Kentucky would not impact us as badly as a Biden backed Kentucky, we would rather see the state be more aligned with our Southern values. We have reached a deal with various Kentucky government diplomats in order to secure that the civil war lands in favor of the Colonel. If we assist the Colonel's government we will see the state become a satellite of the CSA, which could expand our influence on the continent exponentially. Not to mention a Confederate aligned Kentucky could see a business boom as KFC would effectively be the property of our great leader, Kanye West. Effectively speaking, if the Mad Colonel wins, we win; so let's give them everything they need."
 kentucky.12.a:0"Lets go to kentucky"
 kentucky.13.t:0"Rebels Ask for Support"
 kentucky.13.d:0"Rebels aligned with our cause in Kentucky have reached out to us in desperate need of aid.  Supplying them would be a great boost to their ability at undermining our opponents and will allow us to secure influence in the region."
 kentucky.13.a:0"We support our friends"
 kentucky.14.t:0"The impossible"
 kentucky.14.d:0"Against all odds, we have won in Kentucky. Despite funding from the Trump administration, despite inferior training with out troops we pulled it off. The colonel gave  a speech today decrying his opponents as he televised max executions of the rebel forces. He gave his speech eating a bucket of chicken and spoke of how it takes more than just an orange to take down a chicken, obviously a jab at the Trump administration. We could care less for his celebration. We could care less for the beheadings and the purges. By having a friendly government to the north of us we have greater influence in the region against both the Trump states and the Biden states. This is a victory for us as Confederates. The executives of KFC are celebrating and so are we."
 kentucky.14.a:0"We did it"
 kentucky.15.t:0 "Parrott Offers a Pact"
 kentucky.15.d:0 "[KFC.GetLeader] has come to us with an offer of a military alliance, for the sake of uniting America under a Nationalist, economically left group. However, [KFC.GetLeader] has expressed opinions of racial and ethnic superiority, and believes his following of the Russian Orthodox Faith somehow makes him superior."
 kentucky.15.a:0 "We'll make a deal with the devil"
 kentucky.15.b:0 "Tell that Neo-Nazi scumbag where he can shove his pact."
 kentucky.16.t:0 "No Luck with [NRA.GetLeader]"
 kentucky.16.d:0 "The [NRA.GetAdjective] government has rejected our proposals completely, and even followed it up with a denunciation and all sorts of unsavoury insults.\n\nIt looks like there will be no allying with the NazBols to the North."
 kentucky.16.a:0 "Did they have to be so rude about it?"
 kentucky.21.t:0 "Kentucky returns to the fold"
 kentucky.21.d:0 "We have recently been contacted by [KFC.GetName], who have recently self-elected a Pro-Trump president, wishing to fight side by side with the rest of America...\n\n...On the condition of continued autonomy after the Union is restored. What say we?"
 kentucky.21.a:0 "Their fighting spirit will be most valuable."
 kentucky.21.b:0 "No deals with secessionists!"
