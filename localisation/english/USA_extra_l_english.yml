 #Pence and Trump moments
 maga.2.t:0 "Unbelievable Victory"
 maga.2.d:0 "The last Trump forces laid down their arms, and while they fought fiercely to the last bastion, they gave way to common-sense people in their own ranks. As the firing stopped and a white flag was raised over the Provisional Capital Building, the N.P.A. troops walked up the steps of the Provisional Capital building, just as they made it to the final step, a loud eruption was heard, followed by the entire building erupting into the sky. The body of Former President Donald J. Trump was not found, but his eyepatch, wallet and Left Foot was found in the rubble.. Trump's America is no more, just as his vision and tyranny. \n\nLots of Americans from Trump's States with less radical views thanked us for liberating their states from the occupation. Biden, although we counted for his support, had not congratulated our government on its victory. Nevertheless, all our men are sure we need to consolidate what we've gained, uniting the USA further, liberating it on our own for the sake of peace and order."
 maga.2.a:0 "We will rebuild the America. The better America."
 maga.3.t:0 "Pence Defeats Trump"
 maga.3.d:0 "The general chaos and treachery in Trump's party, as well as plenty battles won by the Pence's Supporters' Army had led NPA to unbelievable victory. As the firing stopped and a white flag was raised, the N.P.A. troops walked up the steps of the Provisional Capital building, just as they made it to the final step, a loud eruption was heard, followed by the entire building erupting into the sky. The body of Former President Donald J. Trump was not found, but his eyepatch, wallet and Left Foot was found in the rubble. In his first vicory speech, Pence have proclaimed creation of the United Provinces of America, promising the long-awaited peace and prosperity. \n\nThe people from affected states, exhausted but optimistic about the future, swore their loyalty to the new president."
 maga.3.a:0 "What has just... happened..."
 maga.3.b:0 "We are the Future of America"
 maga.4.t:0 "The War Is Dragging On"
 maga.4.d:0 "The promises of quick victory and peace that Pence had given to his supporters now seem to be rather a far dream, promises some start to doubt. Especially new recruits in the army, have opposed the protracted war by proposing surrender to Trump supporters. \n\nThough their voices have been lost among the voices of Pence's backers, people seem less passionate about our plan, staying on the back of the front or even leaving the army."
 maga.4.a:0 "The time had never never on our side"
 maga.5.t:0 "Civilians Condemn War"
 maga.5.d:0 "Criticism began to appear among our party's politicians and ordinary people. Although they know that war is inevitable, they fear that we will end up in a state where it will never end. Some of our commanders called on us to start negotiations to end the conflict between the Americans. They do not understand that Trump will never agree to such negotiations."
 maga.5.a:0 "We need to hold there for a bit longer"
 maga.6.t:0 "The War Routine"
 maga.6.d:0 "It's been a few months since the war began. Nothing has changed, everyone treats it as everyday life. We can't blame our people, but only ourselves and our promises. We couldn't fulfill them on time. \n\n The war will continue, but the spirit and motivation of our people we started with, is gone. People are less enthusiastic but still believe it can end someday."
 maga.6.a:0 "We shall survive, or we shall perish"
 maga.7.t:0 "What to do with captured NPA members?"
 maga.7.d:0 "During the National Protection War, we captured several prominent political members, many of whom were non-violent political agitators. Among these are prolific writers Ben Shapiro and Dennis Prager, who seem very willing to admit defeat and re-join our cause, providing a slight propaganda value. However, their treachery must not go unnoticed.\n\nWhat are we to do with them?"
 maga.7.a:0 "No Mercy for Traitors. Firing Squad."
 maga.7.b:0 "They will observe the rest of the Civil War from a jail cell."
 maga.7.c:0 "They can keep their lives, but they are not welcome in America anymore. Exile!"
 maga.7.e:0 "I am a merciful, forgiving President. Pardon the non-violent actors."
 maga.8.t:0 "Mike Pence resigns the Presidency"
 maga.8.d:0 "After fully securing the country from the Trumpist menace, Mike Pence has decided his job is done and he is resigning the presidency, citing mental health issues that arose from the National Protection War. The three successor candidates represent the old order of neo-conservatism. John Bolton and Liz Cheney operate on a similar ticket, while underdog Ben Shapiro wants to mobilize his crypto-populist media presence to try and take the vote."
 maga.8.a:0 "President Bolton"
 maga.8.b:0 "President Cheney"
 maga.8.c:0 "President Shapiro"
 maga.8.e:0 "No matter what, we need Pence"
 maga.10.t:0 "Run Run Ronny"
 maga.10.d:0 "DeSantis overlooked the massive crowd of supporters, who gathered around the steps of the capital building. The years had weighed on him heavily, yet his family continued to be there to keep him going. He looked over to his wife and smiled before turning his gaze downwards, towards a piece of paper with his own words scribbled down. He had a fully prepared speech, just for this moment, yet the words did not feel right. He turned the paper over, before looking back up and speaking from the heart.\n\n“To all of Florida, if I have accomplished one thing during my time here, let it be our freedom. Florida remains free from foreign influences, we are free from the totalitarianism to our north, we are free from the regulations from the Biden regime. Let our officials respect and protect our elections, for if they are compromised, so are our freedoms. While I take on a new challenge on this glorious day and go to Denver to assit President Trump, I hope that Florida and her people continue to prosper. Never let the boot of authorities crush your will, and always be prepared to fight for those values you hold dear. Do this, and Florida will always be free. I wave you goodbye on this day, but I will be with each and every one of you within your hearts.”\n\nWith that, Desantis looked across the faces of his adoring fans one final time, before turning towards to helicopter that would fly him directly to President Trump's headquarters. He feared what would become of the great state without his guidance, and who would pick up the torch of freedom afterwards. Although he maintained his faith in the people of Florida, the snarling smiles from his political peers gave him pause. Before the helicopter took off, DeSantis gave a quick prayer, “God be with Florida”."
 maga.10.a:0 "Thank you, Ron, I can take it from here"
 maga.11.t:0 "So long Ronny"
 maga.11.d:0 "Former Governor Ron DeSantis took the stage in front of a dwindling crowd of supporters. He smiled at his wife, who only offered a polite wave in response. He thought back to the days of old, where at one point in time, he ran the entire state with just his will alone. The thousands of adoring fans had mostly splintered towards the current ruling class of Florida, though many still held him in high regard for his role in making Florida a free and independent nation. However, there was not much more left for him to accomplish, as the people had chosen to move beyond his leadership. Though, with every door that closes another open in its place, President Trump seemed poised to reward his loyalty, sending a request for DeSantis to join him in restoring the true America. This was an easy decision to make, while he was held positively in the public eye, there was no shortage of political rivals to combat his influence within Florida politics. His last day in Florida was spent touring the city of Tallahassee one final time, before holding a rally at the nearby International Airport, with his most staunch supporters clambering to hear him one last time, before going quiet to let him speak.\n\n“Thank you, sincerely, thank you for the excellent work you have done. I could not be in this position without the adoring support of you all. Because of you, I was allowed to serve the people and make Florida great again. I led us during the most turbulent time in the formerly United States history, and I worked alongside many great men to establish Florida into the respectable nation we are today. However, I have done all that can be done for my people, and I leave your protection and safety in the hands of a new generation of leadership. But do not think for one moment that I am retiring from the noble goals of public service, no. While I leave Florida today, a new chapter will begin with the great President Trump. I hope to return one day, knowing that I have given all I can give, and finally find peace with that. I look forward to the time in which I am no longer needed as a leader, but only as a father. While I may be gone physically, I will always be looking out for all of you. Though, in the meantime, let us work to make Florida great again and make America whole again.”\n\nWith an uproar of applause, DeSantis kissed his wife and waved goodbye one last time. Entering the helicopter, the feeling of dread overcame him. He worried if he had done enough if he had left Florida in the right hands if he should have fought back for control, but his wife comforted him with her kind words. "
 maga.11.a:0 "We are in God’s hand now"
 maga.12.t:0 "The Military Debate"
 maga.12.d:0 "Our war against the traitors of the NPA has proved to us that our military suffers from issues that must be addressed. Some "reformers" within the military have come up with a whole convoluted plan to completely reassess and reform our armed forces, while many great generals deny that the military needs complete reform, but instead just needs some tweaks. As they complete their dossiers and meet with President Trump which plan will he find convincing?"
 maga.12.a:0 "But which path to choose..."
 
 maga.13.t:0 "Mechanics Bring Old F-16s Back Into Service!"
 maga.13.d:0 ""They are beautiful planes, American planes. Great American Planes really. I told all of my Generals, smart people, great guys; that we need to get these planes back in the sky"\n\nWith the assistance of his Air Force Command Staff, President Trump has launched an initiative to not only un-retire the F-16 but to begin the general production of these older model fighters. They may be older. But they will pack a punch needed for the war to come."
 maga.13.a:0 "They really are beautiful planes"
 maga.14.t:0 "Mechanics Put Old Bell UH-1Hs Back Into Service!"
 maga.14.d:0 "Just as many of our war-weary veterans have once again taken up arms against the tyrant Bidenist regime, so too must the machines of a bygone era be brought from their peace-time lives. All across the regions under our control, military museums, law enforcement agencies, and the civilian population are partaking in President Trump’s “Helo’s for Heroes” donation and industrial program. Factories are currently re-orienting their production of the complicated and sophisticated modern military airframes to the more simple production model of the UH-1 ‘Huey’ Helicopter.\n\nWhile some in the high command are a spectacle of the plan, economists and military production analysts predict that the production of these older models will decrease the resource needs and allow said resources to improve our ground-fighting vehicles and maintain a larger and more sophisticated tank fleet."
 maga.14.a:0 "We require your service once more"
 maga.15.t:0 "Military Reform"
 maga.15.d:0 "President Trump sits surrounded by his General Staff. These men, who despite the crumbling of their lives as they once knew, had remained by his side. Brave men who would help finalize the war plan against the Bidenists. \n\nThe President steepled his fingers in front of him while he listened to their plans. While he tuned out the mindless chatter of his Air Force advisor who was locked in conversation with the currently defunct Naval advisor over the allocation of loyal U.S. Navy Fighter pilots; he did hear the words attrition. His steely blue eye locked onto his U.S. Army advisor whose unbuttoned uniform shirt was emblematic of a man under extreme stress. With a raise of his hand, the room was silent. “Give me your best pitch.”\n\nThe President listened in fascinated disdain at this idea. The idea of grinding down the enemy through the use of their artillery stores, entrenching and letting the Bidenists destroy themselves against their lines. Trump was a showman, and he knew this was one of his biggest strengths. He wanted… no, he needed a touchdown victory, and what else could spell a touchdown like tanks rolling into DC waving his banner high. But, Trump also knew he couldn’t have his show. His men are too few, theirs are so many. As he listened, and took in this plan he came to his decision. Sometimes a show needs to be delayed to get the script just right."
 maga.15.a:0 "Overconfidence will not cause our downfall!"
 maga.16.t:0 "No Reform Needed!"
 maga.16.d:0 "“You West Point morons have no clue what they are talking about.” Boomed President Trump. He had listened to the pitch for attrition warfare and was disgusted. This war wasn’t going to be won sitting in a fox-hole and throwing shells at an enemy, he had to seize victory. He wasn’t going to let it come to him. His Generals frowned as they sat around his desk in his temporary ‘Oval Office’ as some had started calling it. \n\nHe sat down, his rage subsiding as he took a small sip from the tumbler on his desk, the Whiskey warming his stomach. He never used to like the stuff, but since the war started he found it comforting in small doses. As he looked back up at his Generals, the suppressed anger on their face, he smiled. “Sorry guys, you're great, truly great guys. But let's stick to what we know will work.” The frowns didn’t leave their face, but the anger was replaced with a calm resignation of the point. And the decision was made, to keep it traditional."
 maga.16.a:0 "What overconfidence?"
 maga.17.t:0 "The Dire Situation"
 maga.17.d:0 "Trump looked at the proposals from his military advisors. The Army recommended attritional warfare, no surprise. The Air Force recommended more expensive fighters, again no surprise. But one plan caught his eye. The proposal for ‘Operation Swamp Fox’ was tantalizing. It called for a return to the guerilla warfare tactics their ancestors had relied on to defeat a larger conventional force in the past. \n\nNot only would this plan enable their forces to take on the much larger Bidenist forces with higher returns, but it would instill a sense of patriotic nostalgia in his fighters. Militia forces have already flocked to his banner, and utilizing these men as scouts and guerilla troops to disrupt enemy supply chains and eliminate high-value assets would help free up more experienced soldiers for the heavy fighting along the front lines, and allow some of those soldiers to be diverted for rapid strike teams. \n\nWhile some in his cabinet opposed the idea of adopting this strategy, concerned about losing the militia to their fellow countrymen with no oversight, Trump sees no better option to destroy the Bidenist Regime."
 maga.17.a:0 "Assymetrical Warfare Wins? Who would've thought..."
 maga.18.t:0 "News From Tarrio"
 maga.18.d:0 "Great news from Agent Tarrio! He has managed to become the interior minister of the Second Confederacy. An extra front would be massively beneficial to the cause; our conspiracy must continue, for the sake of true American democracy!"
 maga.18.a:0 "Congrats Agent Tarrio!"
 maga.19.t:0 "Officers Protest Strategic Bombing Initiative"
 maga.19.d:0 "The new strategic bombing plan, “Operation Soaring Eagle,” has been met with expected resistance. Officers have protested the use of bombers on American civilians. However, this resistance has not manifested in the High Command, as it has been seen as a “necessary evil” that shall be kept quiet about, as they say;"
 maga.19.a:0 "“Speak no evil, see no evil, hear no evil.”"
 
 maga.20.t:0 "Officers Push to Stop Strategic Bombing!"
 maga.20.d:0 "While some in the upper echelon of our High Command seem to disregard our fellow Americans, the noble men in our officer corps have come to President Trump pleading with him to ignore the developed bombing plan “Operation Soaring Eagle”. We know that should the idea of this operation ever become public, we would surely lose public support extremely quickly, not to mention if we even go through with it. Not only that, many are opposed to even the thought of intentionally seeking bloodshed against fellow Americans, especially civilian targets. Enough blood has been shed on the battlefield, many wish to keep it away from the home fronts, their own or others."
 maga.20.a:0 "No, continue the bombing."
 maga.21.t:0 "Bombing Initiative Leaked!"
 maga.21.d:0 "The young officer corps was right in their prediction. The last thing we wanted to happen has happened, and “Operation Soaring Eagle” has been leaked to the public via user “LocalTrumpResistance_Denver” on Twitter. We aren't sure who conducted the leak and sent it to the Twitter account; it's only time until we find out. In the meantime, protests have already begun in Denver with the already locally popular anti-Trump and anti-war factions in the city springing up at any opportunity to cause chaos and civil disobedience, starting a riot within hours of the leak. A public shunning of the plan is now being put into effect, all while we relocate resources to crush protests in Colorado and attempt to save face. Meanwhile, rival governments have used this to their advantage in every way possible with propaganda."
 maga.21.a:0 "Find the leaker!"
 maga.22.t:0 "Trump's Strategic Bombing Initiative Leaked!"
 maga.22.d:0 "Breaking news from online sources tonight, as new leaks online have exposed Donald Trump's plans to establish a top-secret strategic bombing force under “Operation Soaring Eagle.” The exact use of said bombers is supposed to be used directly against civilian targets such as schools, hospitals, markets, and homes. This was openly laid out in the plan O.S.E. and directly violates many international laws, the same ones Trump claims his adversaries across the divided nation are using themselves. While the total legitimacy of all leaked information is uncertain, this will no doubt leave a bad look on the United States Government for the foreseeable future."
 maga.22.a:0 "Who leaked it?"
 maga.23.t:0 "Airforce Officer Revealed as the Leaker!"
 maga.23.d:0 "After a hefty government search, we believe we have found the culprits of the “Operation Soaring Eagle” leaks. A Major Command Officer by the name of David Richmond and four fellow members of his group were caught exchanging online messages with the leader of the Denver Democrats, Communication Captain, Jackob Smith. Mr. Smith then sent said bombing plans to the aforementioned “LocalTrumpResistance_Denver” on Twitter. Mr. Richmond has been removed along with all of his collaborators, and a clean sweep of all Air Force operational personnel has been initiated so that something like this will never happen again."
 maga.23.a:0 "You're Fired!"
 maga.24.t:0 "Officer Protests to Bombing Initiative Crushed!"
 maga.24.d:0 "Trump narrowed his eyes at the assembled Officers standing in the courtyard below him. His teeth gleamed with a false smile as he began his speech to the nervous men and women below.\n\n“You guys… were supposed to be patriots? Best of the best they said, the cream of the crop. They said that. But you’ve not only betrayed those who spoke so very highly of you, but you betrayed me, and the American people. Quite tragic really, I told the Chief of Staff how tragic this is, unnecessary.”\n\nAs Trump stopped to take a small drink from the glass on his podium, the assembled Officers shared concerned looks as they saw the Military Police standing behind them. Trump continued, “So, you don’t want to follow orders, and worse, three of you decide to leak those orders to the fake news media… Come on, why are you so stupid? Richmond, Smith, Fisher, Green, Hendricks, stay where you are. The rest of you… are fired… and are hereby reassigned to the Infantry.”\n\nAs the seventeen men and women fell out to clear out their quarters, one turned back to look at his five comrades. Just as he entered his barracks, he saw the black bags being placed over their heads as the three were marched away to a fate unknown."
 maga.24.a:0 "You're All Fired!"
 maga.25.t:0 "The New Army"
 maga.25.d:0 "All across the front, trench lines are being erected as the toll of modern warfare has forced a return to tradition. The armchair Cold War dinosaurs remaining in the high command are protesting the return to static warfare and have deemed it a detriment to the rapid maneuver warfare their West Point educations instilled in them. However, younger members of the Officer Corps have proven adept at improvising and adapting to the new conditions of this return-to-formula approach."
 maga.25.a:0 "Let's hope it works..."
 maga.26.t:0 "A Methodical Approach"
 maga.26.d:0 "A glorious army has been assembled, one that will slowly and methodically crush any who stand in our way: “This army shall be the key,” the President said in an interview. “The key to victory against the radical left. There's no army like this one, not in any other place in the world, it's the best one we’ve ever seen.”"
 maga.26.a:0 "Slow and steady wins the race..."
 maga.27.t:0 "Rapid Movement Exercises"
 maga.27.d:0 "Our army has been forced to adapt to all kinds of threats to our great nation. From the colossal Rocky Mountains in our west to the ever-expanding plains and prairies in our east, the true patriots who protect our home are always needed somewhere. Unfortunately, defending our over 6,000,000-mile-long border is no easy task. Due to these concerns, we have decided that it is in our best interests to organize army training and development to focus on the art of speed. While we lack the true military power to carry out an “American Blitzkrieg”, the whole army, from militia to proper military, will receive adequate training to respond quickly to any threats that may arise across our lands. Speed and momentum are our greatest friends in this world."
 maga.27.a:0 "We will crush the Democrats swiftly!"
 maga.28.t:0 "Training for Atrition"
 maga.28.d:0 "Aleesha Aguilar stepped off the hard metal of the transport truck and dropped into the dirt below. The soft thud of her worn combat boots kicked up red dust and was soon echoed by the sound of one hundred other pairs following her from the assembled trucks. Aleesha was told her company was being assigned to Nebraska for “advanced recon training” and what she saw was not what she was promised.\n\nTents were assembled and a small tap served for their supply of water. The tents were civilian in model, and barely functional as they were, and the rust speckling the tap almost screamed tetanus. Standing in front of this ramshackle camp were grizzled men in uniforms whose badges gleamed in the setting sunlight spelling their title, “Forest Ranger.” These were not the special forces instructors she had been expecting. As Aleesha neared, she saw boxes labeled as grenades filled with baseballs and pinecones. She felt the anger boil inside her. Her company hadn’t survived this long to be trained like some African warlords' child soldiers. Just as Aleesha was about to unleash her verbal outrage on the Park Ranger in front of her, a swift punch took her wind and she buckled over. With tears in her eyes, she looked up and in the evening light saw a rough calloused hand extending to her.\n\n“We might not have much, but we will give you all we got. Everything's been sent to the front, so get on your feet and fall in.”"
 maga.28.a:0 ""It’s time to learn.”"
 maga.29.t:0 "Formation of Resistance Cells"
 maga.29.d:0 "As Trump sat and pondered the papers that had been placed before him, a soft knock echoed into his office. After waving for his Secret Service detail to open the door, he was met with his Militia Affairs advisor. The smile spread across the mustachioed man's face usually meant good news was pending. Before the President could indicate for the man to start, the news blurted from his lips, \n“Mr. President, news has arrived that Bidenist troops are being harassed by organized resistance groups across occupied territories. By inserting troops into their back-lines, we have been able to organize the resistance and we hope to see further gains moving forward. So far we can confirm disruption to enemy-occupied industry and ambushes on supply convoys to the front. With aid, we can organize large-scale uprisings in major rural zones.”"
 maga.29.a:0 "Very well, let's send them their guns"
 maga.29.b:0 "Just stay focused on our frontline troops for now"
 
 maga.30.t:0 "Resistance Cells Activate and Become Guerillas!"
 maga.30.d:0 "MEMO\nMR. PRESIDENT\n\nWord has reached the provisional capital of the newly armed resistance fighters being able to secure several footholds in enemy-controlled territory, and a report from Captain Aleesha Aguilar suggests that her platoon has been able to organize several small resistance cells into a Regiment sized fighting element, and her troops are acting as advisors at this time while continuing to signal for further supply drops in the form of arms & ammo. It would appear that training organized with help from civilian Rangers has proved useful and can be utilized across all fronts.\n\nSigned\nCommunications Lieutenant Jacob Highwater\nWestern Command District\nOffice of General Flynn"
 maga.30.a:0 "Good..."
 maga.31.t:0 "The Victory Speech"
 maga.31.d:0 "Following his victory over the treacherous so-called National Protection Alliance, President Trump held a spectacular rally in the newly reconquered city of Indianapolis. Initially jubilant and optimistic, towards the end the President seemed hesitant and sober.\n\nWhat he would go on to reveal would shock the globe to the core;\n\n"Been a while since I was in front of you. I figure I'll stick to the cards this time. There's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on 4chan and at the Capitol...\n\nI know that it's confusing. It is one thing to question the official story and another thing entirely to make wild accusations or insinuate that I'm a superhero...\n\nThat would be outlandish and fantastic. I'm just not the hero type, clearly, with this laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, largely public...\n\nThe truth is...""

When Tulsi ran in the 2020 election, Hillary Clinton alluded to her being a Russian asset. In the debates, she would go out of her way to critize the Democratic Party for having Clinton as a figurehead and also critized how the Democrats handled foreign policy. Gabbard would later become an independent after seeing what the Democratic Party had become but she still shares many policy positions with them."
