 #Pence and Trump moments
 maga.2.t:0 "Unbelievable Victory"
 maga.2.d:0 "The last Trump forces laid down their arms, and while they fought fiercely to the last bastion, they gave way to common-sense people in their own ranks. As the firing stopped and a white flag was raised over the Provisional Capital Building, the N.P.A. troops walked up the steps of the Provisional Capital building, just as they made it to the final step, a loud eruption was heard, followed by the entire building erupting into the sky. The body of Former President Donald J. Trump was not found, but his eyepatch, wallet and Left Foot was found in the rubble.. Trump's America is no more, just as his vision and tyranny. \n\nLots of Americans from Trump's States with less radical views thanked us for liberating their states from the occupation. Biden, although we counted for his support, had not congratulated our government on its victory. Nevertheless, all our men are sure we need to consolidate what we've gained, uniting the USA further, liberating it on our own for the sake of peace and order."
 maga.2.a:0 "We will rebuild the America. The better America."
 maga.3.t:0 "Pence Defeats Trump"
 maga.3.d:0 "The general chaos and treachery in Trump's party, as well as plenty battles won by the Pence's Supporters' Army had led NPA to unbelievable victory. As the firing stopped and a white flag was raised, the N.P.A. troops walked up the steps of the Provisional Capital building, just as they made it to the final step, a loud eruption was heard, followed by the entire building erupting into the sky. The body of Former President Donald J. Trump was not found, but his eyepatch, wallet and Left Foot was found in the rubble. In his first vicory speech, Pence have proclaimed creation of the United Provinces of America, promising the long-awaited peace and prosperity. \n\nThe people from affected states, exhausted but optimistic about the future, swore their loyalty to the new president."
 maga.3.a:0 "What has just... happened..."
 maga.3.b:0 "We are the Future of America"
 maga.4.t:0 "The War Is Dragging On"
 maga.4.d:0 "The promises of quick victory and peace that Pence had given to his supporters now seem to be rather a far dream, promises some start to doubt. Especially new recruits in the army, have opposed the protracted war by proposing surrender to Trump supporters. \n\nThough their voices have been lost among the voices of Pence's backers, people seem less passionate about our plan, staying on the back of the front or even leaving the army."
 maga.4.a:0 "The time had never never on our side"
 maga.5.t:0 "Civilians Condemn War"
 maga.5.d:0 "Criticism began to appear among our party's politicians and ordinary people. Although they know that war is inevitable, they fear that we will end up in a state where it will never end. Some of our commanders called on us to start negotiations to end the conflict between the Americans. They do not understand that Trump will never agree to such negotiations."
 maga.5.a:0 "We need to hold there for a bit longer"
 maga.6.t:0 "The War Routine"
 maga.6.d:0 "It's been a few months since the war began. Nothing has changed, everyone treats it as everyday life. We can't blame our people, but only ourselves and our promises. We couldn't fulfill them on time. \n\n The war will continue, but the spirit and motivation of our people we started with, is gone. People are less enthusiastic but still believe it can end someday."
 maga.6.a:0 "We shall survive, or we shall perish"
 maga.7.t:0 "What to do with captured NPA members?"
 maga.7.d:0 "During the National Protection War, we captured several prominent political members, many of whom were non-violent political agitators. Among these are prolific writers Ben Shapiro and Dennis Prager, who seem very willing to admit defeat and re-join our cause, providing a slight propaganda value. However, their treachery must not go unnoticed.\n\nWhat are we to do with them?"
 maga.7.a:0 "No Mercy for Traitors. Firing Squad."
 maga.7.b:0 "They will observe the rest of the Civil War from a jail cell."
 maga.7.c:0 "They can keep their lives, but they are not welcome in America anymore. Exile!"
 maga.7.e:0 "I am a merciful, forgiving President. Pardon the non-violent actors."
 maga.8.t:0 "Mike Pence resigns the Presidency"
 maga.8.d:0 "After fully securing the country from the Trumpist menace, Mike Pence has decided his job is done and he is resigning the presidency, citing mental health issues that arose from the National Protection War. The three successor candidates represent the old order of neo-conservatism. John Bolton and Liz Cheney operate on a similar ticket, while underdog Ben Shapiro wants to mobilize his crypto-populist media presence to try and take the vote."
 maga.8.a:0 "President Bolton"
 maga.8.b:0 "President Cheney"
 maga.8.c:0 "President Shapiro"
 maga.8.e:0 "No matter what, we need Pence"
 maga.10.t:0 "Run Run Ronny"
 maga.10.d:0 "DeSantis overlooked the massive crowd of supporters, who gathered around the steps of the capital building. The years had weighed on him heavily, yet his family continued to be there to keep him going. He looked over to his wife and smiled before turning his gaze downwards, towards a piece of paper with his own words scribbled down. He had a fully prepared speech, just for this moment, yet the words did not feel right. He turned the paper over, before looking back up and speaking from the heart.\n\n“To all of Florida, if I have accomplished one thing during my time here, let it be our freedom. Florida remains free from foreign influences, we are free from the totalitarianism to our north, we are free from the regulations from the Biden regime. Let our officials respect and protect our elections, for if they are compromised, so are our freedoms. While I take on a new challenge on this glorious day and go to Denver to assit President Trump, I hope that Florida and her people continue to prosper. Never let the boot of authorities crush your will, and always be prepared to fight for those values you hold dear. Do this, and Florida will always be free. I wave you goodbye on this day, but I will be with each and every one of you within your hearts.”\n\nWith that, Desantis looked across the faces of his adoring fans one final time, before turning towards to helicopter that would fly him directly to President Trump's headquarters. He feared what would become of the great state without his guidance, and who would pick up the torch of freedom afterwards. Although he maintained his faith in the people of Florida, the snarling smiles from his political peers gave him pause. Before the helicopter took off, DeSantis gave a quick prayer, “God be with Florida”."
 maga.10.a:0 "Thank you, Ron, I can take it from here"
 maga.11.t:0 "So long Ronny"
 maga.11.d:0 "Former Governor Ron DeSantis took the stage in front of a dwindling crowd of supporters. He smiled at his wife, who only offered a polite wave in response. He thought back to the days of old, where at one point in time, he ran the entire state with just his will alone. The thousands of adoring fans had mostly splintered towards the current ruling class of Florida, though many still held him in high regard for his role in making Florida a free and independent nation. However, there was not much more left for him to accomplish, as the people had chosen to move beyond his leadership. Though, with every door that closes another open in its place, President Trump seemed poised to reward his loyalty, sending a request for DeSantis to join him in restoring the true America. This was an easy decision to make, while he was held positively in the public eye, there was no shortage of political rivals to combat his influence within Florida politics. His last day in Florida was spent touring the city of Tallahassee one final time, before holding a rally at the nearby International Airport, with his most staunch supporters clambering to hear him one last time, before going quiet to let him speak.\n\n“Thank you, sincerely, thank you for the excellent work you have done. I could not be in this position without the adoring support of you all. Because of you, I was allowed to serve the people and make Florida great again. I led us during the most turbulent time in the formerly United States history, and I worked alongside many great men to establish Florida into the respectable nation we are today. However, I have done all that can be done for my people, and I leave your protection and safety in the hands of a new generation of leadership. But do not think for one moment that I am retiring from the noble goals of public service, no. While I leave Florida today, a new chapter will begin with the great President Trump. I hope to return one day, knowing that I have given all I can give, and finally find peace with that. I look forward to the time in which I am no longer needed as a leader, but only as a father. While I may be gone physically, I will always be looking out for all of you. Though, in the meantime, let us work to make Florida great again and make America whole again.”\n\nWith an uproar of applause, DeSantis kissed his wife and waved goodbye one last time. Entering the helicopter, the feeling of dread overcame him. He worried if he had done enough if he had left Florida in the right hands if he should have fought back for control, but his wife comforted him with her kind words. "
 maga.11.a:0 "We are in God’s hand now"

 maga.31.t:0 "The Victory Speech"
 maga.31.d:0 "Following his victory over the treacherous so-called National Protection Alliance, President Trump held a spectacular rally in the newly reconquered city of Indianapolis. Initially jubilant and optimistic, towards the end the President seemed hesitant and sober.\n\nWhat he would go on to reveal would shock the globe to the core;\n\n"Been a while since I was in front of you. I figure I'll stick to the cards this time. There's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on 4chan and at the Capitol...\n\nI know that it's confusing. It is one thing to question the official story and another thing entirely to make wild accusations or insinuate that I'm a superhero...\n\nThat would be outlandish and fantastic. I'm just not the hero type, clearly, with this laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, largely public...\n\nThe truth is...""
 maga.31.a:0 "I am Q-Anon"
 
 maga.162.t:0 "Who Should Lead the Democrats?"
 maga.162.d:0 "After President Trump's decision to support more conservative Democrats, he now has to decide who leads the Democrat Party. He has made a shortlist of three people who he views as the most rational and conservative, those being; Doug Jones, Tulsi Gabbard, and Rod Blagojevich."
 maga.161.a:0 "Former Alabama Senator, Doug Jones"
 maga.161.b:0 "Former Hawaii Congresswoman, Tulsi Gabbard"
 maga.161.c:0 "Former Illinois Governor, Rod Blagojevich"
 maga.229.t:0 "What to offer?"
 maga.229.d:0 "We have an unique opportunity to negotiate with our enemies in the Federal Republic. We don't expeact for much to come out of it, but if we play our cards right we could still gain something from the negotiations."
 maga.229.a:0 "Ask for rural rebels to be pardoned"
 maga.229.b:0 "Ask them to free our POW"
 maga.229.c:0 "Ask them to restore trade relations"
 maga.229.n:0 "End the Negotiations"
 maga.230.t:0 "An interesting offer"
 maga.230.d:0 "Diplomats from Western Canada have send us a message on Trump's behalf. Trump is willing to do something for us if we comply with his requests.\n\n§RTrump's request:§! [USA_offer]"
 maga.230.a:0 "Ask him to free our POW"
 maga.230.b:0 "Ask him to respect the rights of our protestors"
 maga.230.c:0 "Ask him to restore trade relations"
 maga.230.n:0 "We aren't interested in this offer"
 maga.231.t:0 "The Final Verdict"
 maga.231.d:0 "§ROur request:§! [USA_offer]\n§B[FRA.GetLeader]'s request:§! [FRA_offer]"
 maga.231.a:0 "This deal is acceptable."
 maga.231.b:0 "Unacceptable."

 maga.182.t:0 "Trump reveals he is Q-Anon"
 maga.182.d:0 "Shocking events in [USA.GetCapital] today, as President Trump reveals a truth that shocks the world to its very core.\n\nFor years, a secret operative within the U.S. government has been influencing politics with selective leaks and nudges in particular directions- followers of this operative know him as 'Q' or 'Q-Anon', and trust his plan religiously. There has long been speculation on who exactly 'Q-Anon' is, with hundreds of theories. Those theories have been put to bed today, as President Donald Trump makes the shock that reveal that he, in fact, is Q!"
 maga.182.a:0 "WWG1WGA"
 maga.182.b:0 "It was HIM all along?!"

In the debates, she would go out of her way to critize the Democratic Party for having Clinton as a figurehead and also critized how the Democrats handled foreign policy. Gabbard would later become an independent after seeing what the Democratic Party had become but she still shares many policy positions with them."
