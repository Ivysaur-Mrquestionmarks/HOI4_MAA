 #Pence and Trump moments
 maga.2.t:0 "Unbelievable Victory"
 maga.2.d:0 "The last Trump forces laid down their arms, and while they fought fiercely to the last bastion, they gave way to common-sense people in their own ranks. As the firing stopped and a white flag was raised over the Provisional Capital Building, the N.P.A. troops walked up the steps of the Provisional Capital building, just as they made it to the final step, a loud eruption was heard, followed by the entire building erupting into the sky. The body of Former President Donald J. Trump was not found, but his eyepatch, wallet and Left Foot was found in the rubble.. Trump's America is no more, just as his vision and tyranny. \n\nLots of Americans from Trump's States with less radical views thanked us for liberating their states from the occupation. Biden, although we counted for his support, had not congratulated our government on its victory. Nevertheless, all our men are sure we need to consolidate what we've gained, uniting the USA further, liberating it on our own for the sake of peace and order."
 maga.2.a:0 "We will rebuild the America. The better America."
 maga.3.t:0 "Pence Defeats Trump"
 maga.3.d:0 "The general chaos and treachery in Trump's party, as well as plenty battles won by the Pence's Supporters' Army had led NPA to unbelievable victory. As the firing stopped and a white flag was raised, the N.P.A. troops walked up the steps of the Provisional Capital building, just as they made it to the final step, a loud eruption was heard, followed by the entire building erupting into the sky. The body of Former President Donald J. Trump was not found, but his eyepatch, wallet and Left Foot was found in the rubble. In his first victory speech, Pence have proclaimed creation of the United Provinces of America, promising the long-awaited peace and prosperity. \nThe people from affected states, exhausted but optimistic about the future, swore their loyalty to the new president."
 maga.3.a:0 "What just... happened..."
 maga.3.b:0 "We are the Future of America"
 maga.4.t:0 "The War Is Dragging On"
 maga.4.d:0 "The promises of quick victory and peace that Pence had given to his supporters now seem to be rather a far dream, promises some start to doubt. Especially new recruits in the army, have opposed the protracted war by proposing surrender to Trump supporters. \n\nThough their voices have been lost among the voices of Pence's backers, people seem less passionate about our plan, staying on the back of the front or even leaving the army."
 maga.4.a:0 "The time had never never on our side"
 maga.5.t:0 "Civilians Condemn War"
 maga.5.d:0 "Criticism began to appear among our party's politicians and ordinary people. Although they know that war is inevitable, they fear that we will end up in a state where it will never end. Some of our commanders called on us to start negotiations to end the conflict between the Americans. They do not understand that Trump will never agree to such negotiations."
 maga.5.a:0 "We need to hold there for a bit longer"
 maga.6.t:0 "The War Routine"
 maga.6.d:0 "It's been a few months since the war began. Nothing has changed, everyone treats it as everyday life. We can't blame our people, but only ourselves and our promises. We couldn't fulfill them on time. \n\n The war will continue, but the spirit and motivation of our people we started with, is gone. People are less enthusiastic but still believe it can end someday."
 maga.6.a:0 "We shall survive, or we shall perish"
 maga.7.t:0 "What to do with captured NPA members?"
 maga.7.d:0 "During the National Protection War, we captured several prominent political members, many of whom were non-violent political agitators. Among these are prolific writers Ben Shapiro and Dennis Prager, who seem very willing to admit defeat and re-join our cause, providing a slight propaganda value. However, their treachery must not go unnoticed.\n\nWhat are we to do with them?"
 maga.7.a:0 "No Mercy for Traitors. Firing Squad."
 maga.7.b:0 "They will observe the rest of the Civil War from a jail cell."
 maga.7.c:0 "They can keep their lives, but they are not welcome in America anymore. Exile!"
 maga.7.e:0 "I am a merciful, forgiving President. Pardon the non-violent actors."
 maga.8.t:0 "Mike Pence resigns the Presidency"
 maga.8.d:0 "After fully securing the country from the Trumpist menace, Mike Pence has decided his job is done and he is resigning the presidency, citing mental health issues that arose from the National Protection War. The three successor candidates represent the old order of neo-conservatism. John Bolton and Liz Cheney operate on a similar ticket, while underdog Ben Shapiro wants to mobilize his crypto-populist media presence to try and take the vote."
 maga.8.a:0 "President Bolton"
 maga.8.b:0 "President Cheney"
 maga.8.c:0 "President Shapiro"
 maga.8.e:0 "No matter what, we need Pence"
 maga.10.t:0 "Run Run Ronny"
 maga.10.d:0 "DeSantis overlooked the massive crowd of supporters, who gathered around the steps of the capital building. The years had weighed on him heavily, yet his family continued to be there to keep him going. He looked over to his wife and smiled before turning his gaze downwards, towards a piece of paper with his own words scribbled down. He had a fully prepared speech, just for this moment, yet the words did not feel right. He turned the paper over, before looking back up and speaking from the heart.\n\n“To all of Florida, if I have accomplished one thing during my time here, let it be our freedom. Florida remains free from foreign influences, we are free from the totalitarianism to our north, we are free from the regulations from the Biden regime. Let our officials respect and protect our elections, for if they are compromised, so are our freedoms. While I take on a new challenge on this glorious day and go to Denver to assit President Trump, I hope that Florida and her people continue to prosper. Never let the boot of authorities crush your will, and always be prepared to fight for those values you hold dear. Do this, and Florida will always be free. I wave you goodbye on this day, but I will be with each and every one of you within your hearts.”\n\nWith that, Desantis looked across the faces of his adoring fans one final time, before turning towards to helicopter that would fly him directly to President Trump's headquarters. He feared what would become of the great state without his guidance, and who would pick up the torch of freedom afterwards. Although he maintained his faith in the people of Florida, the snarling smiles from his political peers gave him pause. Before the helicopter took off, DeSantis gave a quick prayer, “God be with Florida”."
 maga.10.a:0 "Thank you, Ron, I can take it from here"
 maga.11.t:0 "So long Ronny"
 maga.11.d:0 "Former Governor Ron DeSantis took the stage in front of a dwindling crowd of supporters. He smiled at his wife, who only offered a polite wave in response. He thought back to the days of old, where at one point in time, he ran the entire state with just his will alone. The thousands of adoring fans had mostly splintered towards the current ruling class of Florida, though many still held him in high regard for his role in making Florida a free and independent nation. However, there was not much more left for him to accomplish, as the people had chosen to move beyond his leadership. Though, with every door that closes another open in its place, President Trump seemed poised to reward his loyalty, sending a request for DeSantis to join him in restoring the true America. This was an easy decision to make, while he was held positively in the public eye, there was no shortage of political rivals to combat his influence within Florida politics. His last day in Florida was spent touring the city of Tallahassee one final time, before holding a rally at the nearby International Airport, with his most staunch supporters clambering to hear him one last time, before going quiet to let him speak.\n\n“Thank you, sincerely, thank you for the excellent work you have done. I could not be in this position without the adoring support of you all. Because of you, I was allowed to serve the people and make Florida great again. I led us during the most turbulent time in the formerly United States history, and I worked alongside many great men to establish Florida into the respectable nation we are today. However, I have done all that can be done for my people, and I leave your protection and safety in the hands of a new generation of leadership. But do not think for one moment that I am retiring from the noble goals of public service, no. While I leave Florida today, a new chapter will begin with the great President Trump. I hope to return one day, knowing that I have given all I can give, and finally find peace with that. I look forward to the time in which I am no longer needed as a leader, but only as a father. While I may be gone physically, I will always be looking out for all of you. Though, in the meantime, let us work to make Florida great again and make America whole again.”\n\nWith an uproar of applause, DeSantis kissed his wife and waved goodbye one last time. Entering the helicopter, the feeling of dread overcame him. He worried if he had done enough if he had left Florida in the right hands if he should have fought back for control, but his wife comforted him with her kind words. "
 maga.11.a:0 "We are in God’s hand now"
 maga.12.t:0 "The Military Debate"
 maga.12.d:0 "Our war against the traitors of the NPA has proved to us that our military suffers from issues that must be addressed. Some "reformers" within the military have come up with a whole convoluted plan to completely reassess and reform our armed forces, while many great generals deny that the military needs complete reform, but instead just needs some tweaks. As they complete their dossiers and meet with President Trump which plan will he find convincing?"
 maga.12.a:0 "But which path to choose..."
 
 maga.13.t:0 "Mechanics Bring Old F-16s Back Into Service!"
 maga.13.d:0 ""They are beautiful planes, American planes. Great American Planes really. I told all of my Generals, smart people, great guys; that we need to get these planes back in the sky"\n\nWith the assistance of his Air Force Command Staff, President Trump has launched an initiative to not only un-retire the F-16 but to begin the general production of these older model fighters. They may be older. But they will pack a punch needed for the war to come."
 maga.13.a:0 "They really are beautiful planes"
 maga.14.t:0 "Mechanics Put Old Bell UH-1Hs Back Into Service!"
 maga.14.d:0 "Just as many of our war-weary veterans have once again taken up arms against the tyrant Bidenist regime, so too must the machines of a bygone era be brought from their peace-time lives. All across the regions under our control, military museums, law enforcement agencies, and the civilian population are partaking in President Trump’s “Helo’s for Heroes” donation and industrial program. Factories are currently re-orienting their production of the complicated and sophisticated modern military airframes to the more simple production model of the UH-1 ‘Huey’ Helicopter.\n\nWhile some in the high command are a spectacle of the plan, economists and military production analysts predict that the production of these older models will decrease the resource needs and allow said resources to improve our ground-fighting vehicles and maintain a larger and more sophisticated tank fleet."
 maga.14.a:0 "We require your service once more"
 maga.15.t:0 "Military Reform"
 maga.15.d:0 "President Trump sits surrounded by his General Staff. These men, who despite the crumbling of their lives as they once knew, had remained by his side. Brave men who would help finalize the war plan against the Bidenists. \n\nThe President steepled his fingers in front of him while he listened to their plans. While he tuned out the mindless chatter of his Air Force advisor who was locked in conversation with the currently defunct Naval advisor over the allocation of loyal U.S. Navy Fighter pilots; he did hear the words attrition. His steely blue eye locked onto his U.S. Army advisor whose unbuttoned uniform shirt was emblematic of a man under extreme stress. With a raise of his hand, the room was silent. “Give me your best pitch.”\n\nThe President listened in fascinated disdain at this idea. The idea of grinding down the enemy through the use of their artillery stores, entrenching and letting the Bidenists destroy themselves against their lines. Trump was a showman, and he knew this was one of his biggest strengths. He wanted… no, he needed a touchdown victory, and what else could spell a touchdown like tanks rolling into DC waving his banner high. But, Trump also knew he couldn’t have his show. His men are too few, theirs are so many. As he listened, and took in this plan he came to his decision. Sometimes a show needs to be delayed to get the script just right."
 maga.15.a:0 "Overconfidence will not cause our downfall!"
 maga.16.t:0 "No Reform Needed!"
 maga.16.d:0 "“You West Point morons have no clue what they are talking about.” Boomed President Trump. He had listened to the pitch for attrition warfare and was disgusted. This war wasn’t going to be won sitting in a fox-hole and throwing shells at an enemy, he had to seize victory. He wasn’t going to let it come to him. His Generals frowned as they sat around his desk in his temporary ‘Oval Office’ as some had started calling it. \n\nHe sat down, his rage subsiding as he took a small sip from the tumbler on his desk, the Whiskey warming his stomach. He never used to like the stuff, but since the war started he found it comforting in small doses. As he looked back up at his Generals, the suppressed anger on their face, he smiled. “Sorry guys, you're great, truly great guys. But let's stick to what we know will work.” The frowns didn’t leave their face, but the anger was replaced with a calm resignation of the point. And the decision was made, to keep it traditional."
 maga.16.a:0 "What overconfidence?"
 maga.17.t:0 "The Dire Situation"
 maga.17.d:0 "Trump looked at the proposals from his military advisors. The Army recommended attritional warfare, no surprise. The Air Force recommended more expensive fighters, again no surprise. But one plan caught his eye. The proposal for ‘Operation Swamp Fox’ was tantalizing. It called for a return to the guerilla warfare tactics their ancestors had relied on to defeat a larger conventional force in the past. \n\nNot only would this plan enable their forces to take on the much larger Bidenist forces with higher returns, but it would instill a sense of patriotic nostalgia in his fighters. Militia forces have already flocked to his banner, and utilizing these men as scouts and guerilla troops to disrupt enemy supply chains and eliminate high-value assets would help free up more experienced soldiers for the heavy fighting along the front lines, and allow some of those soldiers to be diverted for rapid strike teams. \n\nWhile some in his cabinet opposed the idea of adopting this strategy, concerned about losing the militia to their fellow countrymen with no oversight, Trump sees no better option to destroy the Bidenist Regime."
 maga.17.a:0 "Assymetrical Warfare Wins? Who would've thought..."
 maga.18.t:0 "News From Tarrio"
 maga.18.d:0 "Great news from Agent Tarrio! He has managed to become the interior minister of the Second Confederacy. An extra front would be massively beneficial to the cause; our conspiracy must continue, for the sake of true American democracy!"
 maga.18.a:0 "Congrats Agent Tarrio!"
 maga.19.t:0 "Officers Protest Strategic Bombing Initiative"
 maga.19.d:0 "The new strategic bombing plan, “Operation Soaring Eagle,” has been met with expected resistance. Officers have protested the use of bombers on American civilians. However, this resistance has not manifested in the High Command, as it has been seen as a “necessary evil” that shall be kept quiet about, as they say;"
 maga.19.a:0 "“Speak no evil, see no evil, hear no evil.”"
 
 maga.20.t:0 "Officers Push to Stop Strategic Bombing!"
 maga.20.d:0 "While some in the upper echelon of our High Command seem to disregard our fellow Americans, the noble men in our officer corps have come to President Trump pleading with him to ignore the developed bombing plan “Operation Soaring Eagle”. We know that should the idea of this operation ever become public, we would surely lose public support extremely quickly, not to mention if we even go through with it. Not only that, many are opposed to even the thought of intentionally seeking bloodshed against fellow Americans, especially civilian targets. Enough blood has been shed on the battlefield, many wish to keep it away from the home fronts, their own or others."
 maga.20.a:0 "No, continue the bombing."
 maga.21.t:0 "Bombing Initiative Leaked!"
 maga.21.d:0 "The young officer corps was right in their prediction. The last thing we wanted to happen has happened, and “Operation Soaring Eagle” has been leaked to the public via user “LocalTrumpResistance_Denver” on Twitter. We aren't sure who conducted the leak and sent it to the Twitter account; it's only time until we find out. In the meantime, protests have already begun in Denver with the already locally popular anti-Trump and anti-war factions in the city springing up at any opportunity to cause chaos and civil disobedience, starting a riot within hours of the leak. A public shunning of the plan is now being put into effect, all while we relocate resources to crush protests in Colorado and attempt to save face. Meanwhile, rival governments have used this to their advantage in every way possible with propaganda."
 maga.21.a:0 "Find the leaker!"
 maga.22.t:0 "Trump's Strategic Bombing Initiative Leaked!"
 maga.22.d:0 "Breaking news from online sources tonight, as new leaks online have exposed Donald Trump's plans to establish a top-secret strategic bombing force under “Operation Soaring Eagle.” The exact use of said bombers is supposed to be used directly against civilian targets such as schools, hospitals, markets, and homes. This was openly laid out in the plan O.S.E. and directly violates many international laws, the same ones Trump claims his adversaries across the divided nation are using themselves. While the total legitimacy of all leaked information is uncertain, this will no doubt leave a bad look on the United States Government for the foreseeable future."
 maga.22.a:0 "Who leaked it?"
 maga.23.t:0 "Airforce Officer Revealed as the Leaker!"
 maga.23.d:0 "After a hefty government search, we believe we have found the culprits of the “Operation Soaring Eagle” leaks. A Major Command Officer by the name of David Richmond and four fellow members of his group were caught exchanging online messages with the leader of the Denver Democrats, Communication Captain, Jackob Smith. Mr. Smith then sent said bombing plans to the aforementioned “LocalTrumpResistance_Denver” on Twitter. Mr. Richmond has been removed along with all of his collaborators, and a clean sweep of all Air Force operational personnel has been initiated so that something like this will never happen again."
 maga.23.a:0 "You're Fired!"
 maga.24.t:0 "Officer Protests to Bombing Initiative Crushed!"
 maga.24.d:0 "Trump narrowed his eyes at the assembled Officers standing in the courtyard below him. His teeth gleamed with a false smile as he began his speech to the nervous men and women below.\n\n“You guys… were supposed to be patriots? Best of the best they said, the cream of the crop. They said that. But you’ve not only betrayed those who spoke so very highly of you, but you betrayed me, and the American people. Quite tragic really, I told the Chief of Staff how tragic this is, unnecessary.”\n\nAs Trump stopped to take a small drink from the glass on his podium, the assembled Officers shared concerned looks as they saw the Military Police standing behind them. Trump continued, “So, you don’t want to follow orders, and worse, three of you decide to leak those orders to the fake news media… Come on, why are you so stupid? Richmond, Smith, Fisher, Green, Hendricks, stay where you are. The rest of you… are fired… and are hereby reassigned to the Infantry.”\n\nAs the seventeen men and women fell out to clear out their quarters, one turned back to look at his five comrades. Just as he entered his barracks, he saw the black bags being placed over their heads as the three were marched away to a fate unknown."
 maga.24.a:0 "You're All Fired!"
 maga.25.t:0 "The New Army"
 maga.25.d:0 "All across the front, trench lines are being erected as the toll of modern warfare has forced a return to tradition. The armchair Cold War dinosaurs remaining in the high command are protesting the return to static warfare and have deemed it a detriment to the rapid maneuver warfare their West Point educations instilled in them. However, younger members of the Officer Corps have proven adept at improvising and adapting to the new conditions of this return-to-formula approach."
 maga.25.a:0 "Let's hope it works..."
 maga.26.t:0 "A Methodical Approach"
 maga.26.d:0 "A glorious army has been assembled, one that will slowly and methodically crush any who stand in our way: “This army shall be the key,” the President said in an interview. “The key to victory against the radical left. There's no army like this one, not in any other place in the world, it's the best one we’ve ever seen.”"
 maga.26.a:0 "Slow and steady wins the race..."
 maga.27.t:0 "Rapid Movement Exercises"
 maga.27.d:0 "Our army has been forced to adapt to all kinds of threats to our great nation. From the colossal Rocky Mountains in our west to the ever-expanding plains and prairies in our east, the true patriots who protect our home are always needed somewhere. Unfortunately, defending our over 6,000,000-mile-long border is no easy task. Due to these concerns, we have decided that it is in our best interests to organize army training and development to focus on the art of speed. While we lack the true military power to carry out an “American Blitzkrieg”, the whole army, from militia to proper military, will receive adequate training to respond quickly to any threats that may arise across our lands. Speed and momentum are our greatest friends in this world."
 maga.27.a:0 "We will crush the Democrats swiftly!"
 maga.28.t:0 "Training for Atrition"
 maga.28.d:0 "Aleesha Aguilar stepped off the hard metal of the transport truck and dropped into the dirt below. The soft thud of her worn combat boots kicked up red dust and was soon echoed by the sound of one hundred other pairs following her from the assembled trucks. Aleesha was told her company was being assigned to Nebraska for “advanced recon training” and what she saw was not what she was promised.\n\nTents were assembled and a small tap served for their supply of water. The tents were civilian in model, and barely functional as they were, and the rust speckling the tap almost screamed tetanus. Standing in front of this ramshackle camp were grizzled men in uniforms whose badges gleamed in the setting sunlight spelling their title, “Forest Ranger.” These were not the special forces instructors she had been expecting. As Aleesha neared, she saw boxes labeled as grenades filled with baseballs and pinecones. She felt the anger boil inside her. Her company hadn’t survived this long to be trained like some African warlords' child soldiers. Just as Aleesha was about to unleash her verbal outrage on the Park Ranger in front of her, a swift punch took her wind and she buckled over. With tears in her eyes, she looked up and in the evening light saw a rough calloused hand extending to her.\n\n“We might not have much, but we will give you all we got. Everything's been sent to the front, so get on your feet and fall in.”"
 maga.28.a:0 ""It’s time to learn.”"
 maga.29.t:0 "Formation of Resistance Cells"
 maga.29.d:0 "As Trump sat and pondered the papers that had been placed before him, a soft knock echoed into his office. After waving for his Secret Service detail to open the door, he was met with his Militia Affairs advisor. The smile spread across the mustachioed man's face usually meant good news was pending. Before the President could indicate for the man to start, the news blurted from his lips, \n“Mr. President, news has arrived that Bidenist troops are being harassed by organized resistance groups across occupied territories. By inserting troops into their back-lines, we have been able to organize the resistance and we hope to see further gains moving forward. So far we can confirm disruption to enemy-occupied industry and ambushes on supply convoys to the front. With aid, we can organize large-scale uprisings in major rural zones.”"
 maga.29.a:0 "Very well, let's send them their guns"
 maga.29.b:0 "Just stay focused on our frontline troops for now"
 
 maga.30.t:0 "Resistance Cells Activate and Become Guerillas!"
 maga.30.d:0 "MEMO\nMR. PRESIDENT\n\nWord has reached the provisional capital of the newly armed resistance fighters being able to secure several footholds in enemy-controlled territory, and a report from Captain Aleesha Aguilar suggests that her platoon has been able to organize several small resistance cells into a Regiment sized fighting element, and her troops are acting as advisors at this time while continuing to signal for further supply drops in the form of arms & ammo. It would appear that training organized with help from civilian Rangers has proved useful and can be utilized across all fronts.\n\nSigned\nCommunications Lieutenant Jacob Highwater\nWestern Command District\nOffice of General Flynn"
 maga.30.a:0 "Good..."
 maga.31.t:0 "The Victory Speech"
 maga.31.d:0 "Following his victory over the treacherous so-called National Protection Alliance, President Trump held a spectacular rally in the newly reconquered city of Indianapolis. Initially jubilant and optimistic, towards the end the President seemed hesitant and sober.\n\nWhat he would go on to reveal would shock the globe to the core;\n\n"Been a while since I was in front of you. I figure I'll stick to the cards this time. There's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on 4chan and at the Capitol...\n\nI know that it's confusing. It is one thing to question the official story and another thing entirely to make wild accusations or insinuate that I'm a superhero...\n\nThat would be outlandish and fantastic. I'm just not the hero type, clearly, with this laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, largely public...\n\nThe truth is...""
 maga.31.a:0 "I am Q-Anon"
 maga.32.t:0 "The Vice-Presidency"
 maga.32.d:0 "Mike Pence was a traitor. And in the aftermath of his great betrayal, President Trump needs a new Vice President. The great struggle may only succeed with the help of a true and loyal man to help him guide the nation back to greatness. Before him lies four options. With these options lies the future of America, as the decisions these men make and the ideology they represent will come to help define the Loyalist movement.\n\nHis first option is Josh Hawley. Josh has been a loyalist from the start. When the Bidenists attempted to seize power, Hawley pushed back and attempted to stall the false election results. Hawley won’t push back against the President’s agenda, but that could also lead to a failure to provide critical insight where it’s needed and essentially lead to a puppet VP which will do little to endear the American people to the President’s cabinet. However, Hawley is also intelligent and ambitious, and providing him a position where he can carry out his policies may be beneficial to the American people, and carry long-term benefits over short-term solutions. But regardless, he is MAGA to the bone!\n\nAnother option is Ben Carson, the classic Evangelical. Focusing on tradition and religion, Carson has a strong Christian base of support and appeals to the God-loving American! However, many of his controvertial stances may result in unwanted resistance...\n\nHis next option is Gavin McInnes. He is an enigma in the Loyalist caucus. His control over the Proud Boy movement is his greatest strength, as the surplus of loyal fighting men would provide immediate benefits to the war effort. However, the first issue with his appointment is his foreign birth. Americans are not one to be led by non-Americans. Especially the loyalists whose nationalistic fervor is fierce. He also brings a level of unpredictability to the Executive Branch. His views are radical to some of the more hardline Republicans and his outspoken distaste for Israel will alienate many Republicans from the MAGA Movement altogether. But in a final boon to his selection, his radio propaganda personality would be a great morale boon to the public, and allow a controlled narrative of the ongoing war effort to be spread. Overall he is a wildball with possible benefits.\n\nHis final option lies with John Thune. Thune is a near-definition moderate by today's standards. In both political terms and attitude, Thune represents an establishment Republican figure who could serve to legitimize the MAGA movement and help endear establishment Republicans to the Trumpist cause. As a proponent for fairer trade deals and modernizing the economy, he could help aid in rebuilding the loyalists' industrial base. However, his lack of more radical views would alienate the more radical members of the Loyalists block and may push some MAGA supporters to the radicals bank if Thune is appointed. After spending his last Presidency railing against RINO Republicans, this move would be a reversal in his beliefs, but the creation of a strong economic base may prove more useful than a handful of do-or-die radicals."
 maga.32.a:0 "All good options, but who to choose?"
 maga.33.t:0 "Josh Hawley's Vice Presidency"
 maga.33.d:0 "When Hawley got the call he was ecstatic. Now he found himself standing on a podium in front of the Provisional Supreme Court of the United States in Denver. Beside Hawley stood President Trump who pulled him in close with a handshake before turning their attention to the judge before them. With a raise of his hand, the Judge summoned silence and began to read from the paper in front of him and instructed Hawley to carefully repeat his words,\n\n“I, Joshua David Hawley, Do Solemnly swear, That I will support and defend the constitution of our United States, against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith, and allegiance to the same, that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation, or purpose of evasion, and that I will and faithfully discharge the duties of the office, on which I am about to enter, so help me God.”\n\nAcross the Loyalist-controlled states, people cheered on televisions and radios for the ‘MAGA Cabinet’ as some had started to call it. This would be the start of the new age for the Loyalist movement, and the energy told a story of a future uncertain. Either they would rise as a phoenix from the ashes and restore the land of endless opportunity, or they would all burn in the fire of their own making."
 maga.33.a:0 "Congrats Mr. Vice President!"
 maga.34.t:0 "Gavin McInnes' Vice Presidency"
 maga.34.d:0 "Gavin had been in the middle of his usual radio rants when his aide gave him the news. At first, he didn’t believe it. McInnes had chided the young man for interrupting his stream until the serious expression finally dawned on him. Gavin had promptly closed the stream early and gave his firmest answer. Now he stood on an elegant podium before the Provisional Supreme Court Building in Denver. He had forgotten a suit and tie and instead wore the ad-hoc uniform of his loyal men and followers as a symbol of their official ascension from Militia to a loyalist power bloc. The Supreme Court Justice before Gavin appeared skeptical and looked to the President whose slight nod confirmed his decision. With a hesitant raising of his hand, the Justice told Gavin to repeat after him, \n\n“I, Gavin Miles McInnes, Do Solemnly swear, that I will support and defend the constitution of our United States, against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will have true faith, and allegiance to the same, that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation, or purpose of evasion, and that I will and faithfully discharge the duties of the office, on which I am about to enter, so help me God.” \n\nThe air was full of ecstasy as the gathered men of the Proud Boy movement began chanting and saluting their leader. The new Vice President signaled something to all the others whose soft claps almost spoke louder than the cheers. This spoke of an uncertain security in their futures, and of the fear that radicalism had finally broken through the very heart of the MAGA movement. It was a fear that what they once believed America to be was finally lost forever, stomped beneath the boot of Militias and strongmen. But optimism was the best weapon against fear, and they needed it."
 maga.34.a:0 "Congrats Mr. Vice President!"
 maga.35.t:0 "John Thune's Vice Presidency"
 maga.35.d:0 "John Thune was skeptical, to say the least. He had been a loyal Republican for decades, but above all else, he was loyal to America. He had tried to avoid party partisanship and tried to push across party lines. The man offering him the Vice Presidency was his antithesis. President Trump had been a stain to bipartisanship, tarnishing any goodwill Thune had built in Congress and burning bridges for Republican lawmakers. But Thune had stayed true to the party platform and did his best. During the election crisis, he had voted to certify Biden, a move that had thus far alienated him from the Loyalists, and relegated him to relative mediocrity since the flight west. However, Trump was offering an olive branch. He wanted to bring Thune back into the fold, to get him to rejoin the effort and help re-unite the MAGA movement and the Republican Party. With a slight pang in his heart, Thune knew what he had to do. If he wanted to save America, he would have to work with the man who some thought broke it. He would help guide this nation back to greatness."
 maga.35.a:0 ""Yes Mr. President, I’ll do it.""
 maga.36.t:0 "Negotiations With the Private Sector"
 maga.36.d:0 "Since he was sworn in, Thune was assigned a task so monumental, that he thought maybe Trump had trapped him into a position of failure. One last task is to destroy his legacy. He was to rebuild the American economy from scratch and make it the powerhouse needed to win the war.\n\nHis first step was to renegotiate with private corporations around the controlled territories. One by one he brought them to the negotiating table to gain the support needed to help employ refugees and restart the war machine. So far he has convinced elements of the John Deere Corporation to contribute to tank manufacturing and government work programs, while California industrialists have offered to shift production from hostile territories for guarantees of protection from Communists. So far over thirty private corporations have joined hands with the Trump administration and will aid in war manufacturing while trying to balance the need for consumer good production. While the price tag may be high, the promised free-market changes following the war have helped keep contract pricing at a reasonable level."
 maga.36.a:0 "We must mobilize the economy!"
 maga.37.t:0 "The Dakota Development Act"
 maga.37.d:0 "The next step in the revitalizing of the economy is the Dakota Development Act. If all parameters of the act are met, steel production and mining efforts in the Dakotas will be nearly tripled, and allow us to handle the refugee unemployment problems in the states. With the act also comes expansion to the coal industry which will help solve energy production concerns and keep houses lit and may contribute to the production of synthetic rubbers and similar products.\n\nAs John Thune negotiates its implementation, some questions regarding worker safety are brought forward and while some critique the vagueness of the DDA in addressing these concerns it is generally considered acceptable to the state of war the nation finds itself in."
 maga.37.a:0 "The former senator uses his connections..."
 maga.38.t:0 "Realigning the Republicans"
 maga.38.d:0 "While ongoing efforts to revitalize the economy are underway, Thune is given another serious task. Realign the Republican Party. Since the start of the war, the Republican party has been silently accused of undermining the MAGA movement's efforts and in some cases committing to vocal protests of the President’s action leading civilians' trust in the government to decrease. \n\nThune proposes that to realign the party as Trump so desires, he needs to concede to the demand of deradicalization. Thus far the Provisional Cabinet has been made of do-or-die loyalists and radicals who seek a mass disruption of the system, causing many conservatives to be pushed away from supporting the Trump government. While making this step will certainly cause uproar in the movement, if done it will allow the legitimacy of the government to be improved and perhaps restore public trust in the effort. \n\nThe second proposal is the support of establishment Conservatives who Trump had sidelined since his first Presidency. If Trump can ensure their positions and promotions into higher government positions, they can help keep the establishment Republicans firmly loyal and in support of the administration."
 maga.38.a:0 "It's all about trade..."
 maga.39.t:0 "Investments and Military Support"
 maga.39.d:0 "The stuffy air of the “New Oval Office” felt like a noose to Thune. He dreaded every meeting he had with his new boss, and he had the strong sense that perhaps that feeling was mutual. But despite the coolness of the President’s gaze, he knew that there was at least a modicum of respect for the work that had already been underway. \n\n“Thune, you’ve made great headway, amazing headway really, but I need more tangible results. Sure, mines are great, but I need guns. I need tanks, and most of all I need planes. Great planes. So tell me what you can do to get the actual tools I need to win this war.”\n\nThune gazed cooly back at the President and with the resigned nod of a man who understood his place he placed the folder he was carrying on the President’s desk. “Mr. President, if we can reach out to sympathetic companies outlined in that proposal, and offer some investments into their industries, we may be able to rely on their continued support throughout the war. It will be hard in some cases, and concessions may be needed. But I can help grease the wheels as needed.”"

 maga.40.d:0 "[ROOT.GetRepublicanLeader] sat behind the desk of the his office when his phone rang. \n\n[ROOT.GetRepublicanLeader] had heard stories from his grandad about how great companies went from making plows to tanks during the Second World War, and that this factory, in particular, had once manufactured variants of small arms for American GIs. He never once imagined he would be in the position that so many found themselves in during those dark times. But here he was, receiving the offer from President Trump to go from tractors to tanks, just like Grandad.\n\nFactories across the loyalist territories tell a similar story, as the President continues negotiations with the treasury and loyal companies to fuel the war effort. But already, the fruit of Thune’s labor is paying off as the first Loyalist-manufactured Abrams enter the field."

 maga.41.t:0 "Companies Demand Removal of Trade Restrictions"
 maga.41.d:0 "Thune was tired. He had been negotiating for what seemed like hours with some upstart farmers about military ration contracts. And now his appointment with the President was sure to be frostier than usual as he was now eight minutes late. His footsteps to the President’s office echoed through the corridor, and he counted the steps in his mind, more to keep himself awake than anything else.\n\nWhen he was finally seated in the President's office he presented the newest dilemma before the President could chide him for being late. “Sir, some of the major corporations in our territory are requesting trade restrictions be lifted in exchange for providing the Military equipment you need to continue the war effort. These restrictions range from environmental precautions to tariff restrictions. If we lower our tariffs we could see a hit to our economy in the immediate aftermath, but it could also increase our production output and long-term earning power following our victory.” The President just gazed up and with a cool expression stated,"
 maga.41.a:0 "“Give them what they want.”"
 maga.42.t:0 "Sidelining the Radicals"
 maga.42.d:0 "Thune and Trump sat in silence. The President’s cool gaze was fixed firmly to the recommendations Thune had made in his newest proposal. Gaining support from the Republican establishment hadn’t been easy, but through careful political maneuvering and small concessions, he had done it. Now however, a larger question needed to be answered. \n\nThune recognized something Trump may not yet have fully understood. Trump was focused on the here and now, and wielded the radical supporters of his base like a hammer against his opposition. But if the President truly wanted the loyalty of the establishment, he needed to look beyond his hammer, and instead focus on the wider effort. But Thune also knew Trump was a shrewd businessman, and never took a new idea for granted. \n\nAfter several more minutes of silence, the President turned his eye to Thune. “You think this will work? You think the suits will fall in line after this is all finished?” Trump held up the stack of papers to emphasize his point. “Yes Mr. President, if we sideline these radical elements, we can more effectively call upon the more moderate elements, and wield a wider base of support.” Trump was silent for another few moments. With a small look of sadness, perhaps guilt? Trump nodded to Thune, "
 maga.42.a:0 "“Let's do it.”"
 maga.43.t:0 "The Radicals Attempt a Putsch!"
 maga.43.d:0 "The night air was silent as men and women unloaded the rifles and grenades from the back of their pickups. These fighters, soldiers being too kind a word, began a steady march towards the “New White House” lawn. Among these men was Andrew Theriault.\n\nNervous faces appeared in the windows, looking down at this band of irregulars who had vowed to remove Thune from power and “Restore the MAGA Spirit” they thought had been usurped. No negotiations, no offers of amnesty would be accepted. Heroism was the only thing on Andrew’s mind. He had been loyal to Trump since the beginning, and he would prove his loyalty now, he would free him from these RINOs who had taken the power from the movement they so rightfully fought for. These were his thoughts when the bullets started flying. \n\nThe streets were ablaze as the carefully planned ambush was sprung. Secret Service Agents, Intelligence Officers, and Loyalist troops assigned to the capital garrison emerged from concealment with weapons raised. Confusion overwhelmed Andrew, and he saw as patriot upon patriot fell in a hail of bullets. This wasn’t supposed to happen he thought, as he felt the first bullet pierce his chest. This wasn’t supposed to be the end. \n\nThe President announced the next day the death of forty seven “radicals” and the capture of an additional thirty eight. And with this final firefight, the beginning of the end of the radical movement as they once had been was signalled. This was the start of a new era for Trumpism."
 maga.43.a:0 "This will be the start of a new era."
 maga.44.t:0 "Radicals Protest Thune's Presidency"
 maga.44.d:0 "Andrew Theriault stood in front of the line as they marched through the provisional capital. The swell of voices rose like currents on an ocean he hadn’t seen in years. He had served his nation dutifully, he had been betrayed by the Obama Regime, he had been a loyal supporter of the MAGA movement, but now he had been betrayed again. The RINO’s had usurped the President’s power, he felt it in his bones. He knew that Trump wouldn’t do this to him, he loved those like him. The down and out, the veterans, the supporters he had relied upon to get him here. Now Andrew and these bands of “radicals” as the RINOs had called them, would restore the MAGA movement to power, and they were going to do it soon."

 maga.45.t:0 "Opposition to Thune's Vice Presidency Grows Among Radicals"
 maga.45.d:0 "The Radicals stood around the radio, listening to the plans set in motion by Thune the Tyrant. They all agreed what this man was doing was akin to treason. No way Trump had unleashed this man on them, no way he willingly chose this man to stand by his side. MAGA senators were one by one voting for the Thune Development Plans, and the votes were being finalized. Rage seethed through their bones. These men and women who were so loyal to the President bent to a plan set in motion by a man who refused to side with the loyalists on that fateful day. Andrew could feel the anger boiling inside him, and he knew what he had to do. That day, accompanied by those of them brave enough to recognize what they needed to do, Andrew set in motion a plan to save the MAGA movement. If their senators would not heed their warnings, their demands, then they would do it themselves. They would remove Thune."

When finally a Secret Service Agent emerged to beckon him inside, Thune pushed his way past and threw the papers on the President’s desk.\n\n“A national guard armory was raided by your followers. They have it in mind that you’re some sort of puppet president. They are calling for my head Donald! Are you going to do something about this shit or just sit on your ass!” The cool gaze of the President stopped any further exclamations from Thune. He had never taken this tone before, and the icy danger in the room told him it was likely the only time he would use it. The President slowly lowered his head and read the report before him, its papers now scattered across his desk. “John, one of these groups is a day's drive away, we have plenty of time. Now we could drone strike them, we have beautiful drones John, or we could make a true show of force. People want a show John, they need one really.

I want to reassert the absolute importance of loyalty to the movement and your country. We are at the dawn of an all-out war against our ideological opponents, and this will require total focus on the objective. We must, no, we WILL unite America. Bringing freedom to our brothers and sisters from the radical left and totalitarian systems that have come to occupy both coasts of our nation is the number one priority.” \nThe President finished the first part of his speech and moved aside from the podium for Vice President Hawley. Hawley didn't usually speak at private events like this, but today was different, and a very important meeting. \n“Thank you, Mr. President. To all of you in the room today, I say to you, personal gain will get you nowhere. You all know why you are here and what happened to your predecessors.

How did this happen?” \n\n“Mr. President, I can assure you these are only due to temporary setbacks. I have only continued what previous men in my position had started. I believe that I have a chance to rally the government under our direct control, and it all starts with who we employ. Last year, I appointed Ivanka Trump as head of the Department of Labor, and I have plans to see if Ivanka wants to be head of the Department of Agricu-”.

In response to this, the President has suspended the right to protest temporarily. Trump said these protests will not be tolerated and has sent in the National Guard to put any potential movements to an end. The administration claimed the temporary suspension was to ease the transition back to normalcy, if a protest is allowed to get out of hand, the threat to peace would be too high to allow. Protests continue to clash with police and military personnel. While small protests have been allowed for the moment, gatherings of 10 or more have reportedly been placed under scrutiny. Some fear that Trump will refuse to revoke his ban on protest, citing instances of temporary actions becoming permanent post-9/11. However, Trump has stated these fears are simply related to TDS, or Trump Derangement Syndrome, and hopes treatment will alleviate their pain."

When I saw he was running for President, I came out in hopes to stop him but I was silenced by the media and elite.” She spoke confidently but DeSantis noticed a slight hesitation in her voice, so he decided to move forward to his next witness, a children psychologist, Dr. Flanders. \nHe directed focus to a screen showing multiple examples of Mr. Biden and how his body language shifted when children were nearby. He asked, “Mr. Flanders, does this appear to be normal behavior?” The psychologist went on at length about the potential predatory behavior, pointing to hand placement and how Mr. Biden moved into the young girls' space as examples.

Regardless Roberts had a job to do and allowed the next witness to be called. \n“Tell me what were you before the war, before Biden started this war”, DeSantis leaned into a shell-shocked veteran. “I was studying engineering at university sir”, he flinched at an electrical alarm. \n“Now tell me, you were top of your class correct”, DeSantis turned and walked back to his notes on the table. “Yes mister, I was in the running to study at MIT, but now I can't even hold a pen.” \nDeSantis stopped, turned, and pointed directly at the veteran, “And who do you blame for taking away that future from you?” The man stared ahead, living a lifetime over and over in those moments, before answering, “Biden sir, he took everything from us.” The defense attorney buried his head in his hands."

Trump helped the boy back up to his feet, and stated firmly, “Son, I'm proud of you, there's no need for you to apologize, we owe you a debt.” President Trump took his seat and prepared for the questions that followed. \nDeSantis asked what evidence Trump had, and he discussed irregular voting habits in Detroit and Atlanta, digital errors with dominion, and the Democrats' obstructionist behaviors. However, during cross-examination, the young man watched Trump's kind demeanor melt away. The once soft eyes hardened when questioned on the validity of these claims, and when the attorney hypothesized that Biden may have won fairly, pandemonium erupted.

Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News host, suggested a drastic method, which might just work. He proposed using a hitman to bring Biden back, similar to a bounty hunter. Additionally, Hegseth claimed to know the best hitman this side of the Mississippi, a man who goes by the name “Sir Johnny Sins”. When Mr. Sins was brought before Trump, they appeared to find common ground with their love of exotic films.

This was met with a kick to the face and a blood-soaked nose. Trump placed his foot on the head of Mr. Sins and pressed him further into the ground. “You have disappointed me, and I am not a man who you can disappoint twice. Dr. Peterson, how many patriots are waiting for organ transplants in our city?” \nDr. Peterson, the chief medical officer, cleared his throat, “Nearly too many to count, many of our soldiers have died waiting for transplants.” \nTrump smiled, “In that case, we've found a use for this fraudulent hitman.” Mr. Sins looked in horror as guards dragged him out of the room, unable to comprehend the horror awaiting him."

Finally, his thoughts landed on his wife and children, he wondered if the world would truly be better off when it was all over, but he tightened his hand into a fist to strengthen his resolve. His mind was snapped from repetition by movement. \nJustice Roberts sat down in the central chair with Justices Thomas and Barrett flanking his right and left respectively.

Justice Roberts overruled this motion and the witness was allowed to continue. Throughout his testimony, he continued to stop and stare at Saul, who continued to click his pin in an almost familiar rhythm. \nWhen Saul walked up to the soldier, he asked one simple question, “For everything you blame my client for, could you not put the same blame on Mr. Trump?” The room gasped, but increased security made sure no riots broke out. Saul continued, “Is it not true that Mr. Trump and Biden could have come to an agreement that wouldn't lead to bloodshed? Could they have not asked the Supreme Court…” he turned and looked directly at the 3 Justices, “...to moderate just as they had done during Bush v. Gore?” \nThe soldier attempted to answer but he was drowning in a sea of thoughts, the words dissolving on his tongue. Then he heard that familiar clicking again. Saul spoke, “Under your logic, Trump could be just as guilty of treason as Mr. Biden, do you believe Mr. Trump is guilty of such accusations.” \nThe man shook his head and pleaded for a moment of silence, but even the hum of electricity melted the sanity he grappled for control over.

LaPlant testified about irregularities and brought forward the evidence discussed in the previous trial. It was all but ironclad. \nMr. Good Man attacked the witness with one line of argument, where was the evidence? The witness claimed a study he published at the University of Oklahoma, but this study was only published In local newspapers and state journals. While Saul was perfectly aware of the dangers in pushing the issue, given the previous defense attorney was found dead, burned, flayed, and hung from a bridge, he also knew there were only so many cards to play. So he asked, if every judge rejected this evidence and the Supreme Court refused to intervene, how can we truly say my client didn't win the election? Furthermore, if he did win the election, what does that say about Mr. Trump?”\nSuddenly a worker's boot hit Mr. Good Man on the back of his head. Chaos erupted as police and rioters clashed.

Biden may have acted oddly in those videos, but no accusations have been made against him, unlike Mr. Trump who was accused by Stacey Williams in 1993, oddly enough the same year as when Reade accused Biden and many others. He slammed the accusations of treason by tying both Biden and Trump together on this issue. If one was guilty, then they both were his claim. Saul pointed out there is no substantial evidence that the 2020 election was stolen, and this would further indicate that Biden was the rightful President. Finally, Mr. Good Man pointed out Biden's mental health, stating he was unfit to stand trial in any form. The very reason he didn't testify in this very trial was due to that fact. This show had dragged an elderly confused man into a world he no longer recognizes. \nThe Justices retired to their chambers. They went back and forth, looking over the evidence, before deciding their verdicts. Roberts sided with Biden on all 3 counts, claiming it was time for the country to heal and we should follow the example that the Union put forward concerning General Lee. Thomas disagreed, supporting a guilty verdict. He wrote that Biden was the direct cause of needless death and destruction, and was responsible for setting America back decades. Punishment must be handed out, and Justice for the dead must be swift. The final vote came down to Barrett, who spent much of the deliberation in deep thought.

Trump put his hand up and the room went silent, he smiled as he looked around and saw politicians wearing MAGA hats. The President leaned into the microphone.\n“My Fellow Americans, we have unified together as patriots to make America the greatest it has ever been. My leadership has been so great that I have been voted in for another term, but unfortunately it's not enough. Many radical leftists and treasonous extremists are still out in America, hiding away, afraid that we will catch them and believe me, we will catch them. They are attempting to sabotage our great nation that we have created, but there is no need to worry, as long as I am in charge, I will not allow any sort of extremists and terrorists to destroy America, and to not let that happen I am introducing a big beautiful bill, rightfully named the Presidential Expansion act, which will allow Presidential Terms to be expanded in order for the President to complete their agenda without the limitation of the extremely short time frame they are given. Along with this, I will be introducing and passing the Expanded Powers Act, which allows the President to make more decisions without the need for a vote from Congress, which will allow the President to get more done.”\nThe room once again flooded with applause, the President had successfully gained support from most Americans, with an approval rating of over 91%, President Donald Trump was being recognized as one of the best, if not, the Best President that the United States has ever had. He leaned into the microphone once more.\n\n“We Will Continue to Make America Great Again!”\n\nAs America is unifying under the leadership of President Trump I wanna ask, doesn’t it feel good? Finally Making America Great Again? Uniting the People together under one banner? You didn’t disappoint. But, could it have been different? Who knows, but relax, you did it. Congratulations!

We are the rightful rulers of America, we are the center of the world, we are the pinnacle of humanity. The days of liberal weakness are over, for we shall embrace the potential which they locked away. For too long they allowed foreigners to control you, to take what was rightfully yours. They stole your safety, they stole your peace, they stole your future and your children's future. All so they could sell you into slavery while melting your minds with propaganda. No, we say no more. They dared call me, offering me all the riches and pleasures of this world. They tried to buy me, tried to have me betray you, betray my family. No my friends, we will not be bought, we will not be bargained with, we shall not be bombarded into submission. Yesterday, we fought to restore what we had lost. Today, we celebrate our triumph. Tomorrow, we bring the world to its knees. They will know that the world belongs to us, to America. We will force them to their knees, and break them. We are the pinnacle of humanity, let them embrace us or fall into the void of irrelevance. For the Republic, for our liberty, for America.\nMcInnes raised his glass to the crowd as they chanted his name. \n\nAmerica is in good hands knowing that its leader will never throw it behind, after a ton of promises, America is finally put first.

I don’t think anyone could have prevented this war, as it needed to happen for us to clean the rot. However, we both regret that it had to happen.” \nThe interviewer paused, somewhat taken aback by the humanity of the answer, “How do you meet the moment? How do you stand in the shoes your father once stood? How do you address the worry that you have become the Trump dynasty? \n“Political dynasties have existed throughout our nation's history, Bush, Roosevelt, and Clintons are all major families in our history. Yes, it is unique how I step in right after my father, but let us not forget the role I played in the war, how I helped unite the world. Through my actions, I will alleviate their fears.” \n“Are there any major policies you want to focus on in your first 100 days?”\n“Cleansing corruption from the Democratic and RINO parties, they brought up into war, they will do it again the moment we give them an inch of power. We must indicate their evil wherever we find it. I promise you, all of America, that I will give everything to protect you. They will fight me at every stage, but we will win. That is my promise to the American people, not one step back.”\n\nAmerica has finally arrived once again on the world stage, the eagle that was feared all over the world has returned all because of you.

He ran a campaign which was very similar to Bush’s 2000 election, focusing on kitchen table issues and driving the economy. He stood out from the crowd that desired retribution and punishment of those who fought against them. He stretched his hand out, before speaking. \n“My fellow Americans, it has been a long night, but do you see that?” Thune pointed towards the morning sun, “That is our future, a new day, rising over the hills. I ask you, have we not suffered enough. We are the United States for God’s sake, we have placed brother against brother, daughter against father, neighbor against neighbor for too long. The war is over, it is time for healing. As my first act as President, I will direct emergency funding towards those cities and towns which were directly impacted by the war, regardless of their political affiliation. I will not demonize Democrats for voting against me, I will work with them to find common sense solutions. President Lincoln’s words were proven correct by our actions, that a house divided can not stand, so I ask you this day, shall we remain divided or united? This is the question at the heart of my campaign, and you choose unity. As God as my witness, I promise to bring both sides together and force them to work for you, the people.

I will not lead with fear in my heart, I will not let the thoughts of failure control me, I will not abandon our Lord in our time of need. No my friends, I shall not. I will embrace power, the power to do what is right, the conviction to go against what may be unpopular, to fight for a sunrise I will never see. I will embrace love for my fellow man, for my neighbor, and even my enemies, lord knows they love to talk about me. Finally, I will use my sound mind to consider all options and choose the best path for our future. We are in a trying time, but we must ban together in order to meet the moment. When it is all done, then I shall follow the example laid out just a few verses later, I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. From now on there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day and not only to me, but to all who crave His appearance.” \nCarson looked up to the crowd, “Now, can I get an Amen?”\n\nWow, America is now truly Blessed by God.

It is likely we will be able to maintain the peace and it provides the best city for building our new HQ. Omaha offers a balanced approach, as we control the territory surrounding Nebraska. It will allow us to build up slowly while managing the damage. St. Louis offers an aggressive approach, as it places us in a position to strike the Midwest.

Before, they used to care for the people, pushing for universal healthcare, free colleges, and better social security, but now they only worry about gun control, abortion rights and safeguarding “democracy”, and have completely forgotten about working class citizens. They appeal way too much to the richer folk. In our nation however, we have shown that Communism cares and looks out for the working class.

 maga.261.t:0 "Carson Announces Death of Secularism"
 maga.261.d:0 "Ben Carson had approached the podium, he was just about to announce one of, if not his most important move towards the future of America.\n\n“My fellow Americans, I am proud to announce the removal of the separation of Church and State. We shall no longer be separated from the Lord and ignore his words. We will align more policies to make towards the Lord's teachings. Every city will be required to have a church for every 35 Thousand residents, and we are working on instating a law that will make attending mass mandatory. We will lose our faith no longer and we will learn to be the disciplined servants of the Lord.”\n\nThe crowd started with a slow applause, gradually getting better. Most of his colleagues weren’t even aware of the topic of the speech today, and many weren’t happy either. \n\nYet, they stayed silent."
 maga.261.a:0 "May God be with us"
 maga.262.t:0 "Major Protests Over End of Separation of Church and State"
 maga.262.d:0 "“Hello everyone, welcome back to the American Christian Network, my name is David Brody and today we are pleased to introduce a very special guest. Ladies and Gentlemen, I bring to you Ben Carson! Mr Carson, on behalf of everyone here, we are thankful for you allowing us to get closer to the lord! \n\nIt's my pleasure Brody, unfortunately the Democrats in the cities were not too happy with the announcement of the Lord getting closer with us, they have begun mass protests in multiple cities.\n\nOh Mr Carson, I think it's disgusting that they don’t appreciate your work and effort to get us closer to the Holy land.\n\nI agree, they’re doing nothing but proving that they’re demons in human bodies. They refuse to accept the teachings of the lords, and they believe that their word is better. Not to worry, our police officers as well as volunteers are going to stop the spread of these horrible people and their “teachings.”\n\nThat's fantastic news Mr Carson. Ladies and Gentlemen we will be right back to discuss the problem of these satanists, after these messages.”"
 maga.262.a:0 "Nothing big, right?"
 maga.263.t:0 "Protests Expand"
 maga.263.d:0 "Following the interview with Ben Carson, cities all over the United States continue to expand, which is leaving many of the cities trashed and filled with robberies. Police are becoming overwhelmed."
 maga.263.a:0 "This is getting out of hand..."
 maga.264.t:0 "Moderate Republicans Join Protests!"
 maga.264.d:0 "Things are getting out of control in our great nation. Independent-minded voters and moderate Republicans are beginning to protest alongside the traitorous Democrats. RINO senators are voting against everything we are trying to pass just because we decided to abolish the separation between church and state. We must go through drastic measures to save our nation from carnage."
 maga.264.a:0 "Traitors!"
 maga.265.t:0 "The Longterm Strategy to Weaken Opposition"
 maga.265.d:0 "President Trump and Vice President Carson sit in the oval office. A discussion between the both of them arises, the topic being how to permanently weaken the Democrats and how to make them unpopular. \n\nCarson then brings an interesting proposal.\n\n“Well I think that manipulating the school curriculum to make the Democrats look bad would work very well.”\n\nPresident Trump seems intrigued in the idea, then sparks his own.\n\n“We would try using social media to make them look bad, the Russians use bots all the time, and frankly, it seemed to work most of the time”\n\n“Well it looks like we have our plan, and if this works, it will be extremely hard for the Democrats to return to power, the Republicans will dominate for years to come”\n\nThey both leave the office, off to set their plan into motion."

 maga.266.t:0 "A Christian America, Under Trump"
 maga.266.d:0 "The War was over. And as war does, it makes places of insignificance famous throughout history. This location, like so many, was not a product of careful planning and construction, but one of necessity. Its rugged wooden name boards are slowly being replaced by fine marble. This little collection of meadows where once cows grazed and meandered was now one of the newest national cemeteries, hallowed not by religious decree, but by the blood of American patriots. \n\nPresident Trump now stood on a small platform, unusually humble for his nature. He raised his eye to the assembled crowd, many missing limbs, or bearing the wounds of the war he had waged. Some claim a lone tear fell from his eye when he began his Victory Day Speech, others say it was just the sun in his eye. \n\n“My fellow Americans. Today marks the official end of all hostilities within the United States of America. This Republic, built upon the values of sacrifice, freedom, and hard work has endured once more a great test of arms. This war, whose name will be decided by historians for generations, is America’s final example to the world of our commitments to the goals upon which our Founders built this nation. Many before you bear the scars of this war, so terrible a war. Many of you may never hold loved ones for who gave the fullest measure for their country. This nation, built with the guiding hands of God, who bestowed great wisdom to our ancestors shall endure, must endure, and will once again prosper as it never has before. But just as any wound must heal, we must heal this great wound upon the nation. We must begin the reconstruction of the great experiment. We will once again forge a future built upon the strength of American men and women, and not the cheap labor that broke the back of the working class. We will bring God to our hearts once more, and seek his wisdom and guidance in this great endeavor, and my fellow Americans; we will Make America Great Again.”"

Gabbard would later become an independent after seeing what the Democratic Party had become but she still shares many policy positions with them."
