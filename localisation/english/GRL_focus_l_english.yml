# Events
greenland_nato_crisis.1.t:0 "The NATO Crisis"
greenland_nato_crisis.1.d:0 "Ever since Russia declared war on Ukraine, things have been tense in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization between Britain and France, who failed to fill the power vacuum ever since America collapsed. Now the alliance has split, with Britain and Canada leaving and going on their own path. \n\nThis has caused concern in Greenland, where a sense of vulnerability has taken hold. Many feel NATO (and by extension Denmark) can no longer protect them in the same capacity they used to."
greenland_nato_crisis.1.a:0 "Relax! Everything is fine..."

greenland_nato_crisis.2.t:0 "The Next Move"
greenland_nato_crisis.2.d:0 "After escalation of public anxiety following the collapse of NATO, a referendum has been called regarding the independence of Greenland, as well as Danish membership in the remnants of NATO. The result is extremely close, and in the end, no side may emerge happy with the outcome."
greenland_nato_crisis.2.a:0 "Enough of this talk! Nothing has changed!"
greenland_nato_crisis.2.b:0 "What has Denmark ever done for us?"

greenland_nato_crisis.3.t:0 "The Royalist Coup"
greenland_nato_crisis.3.d:0 "Following the successful referendum that realized Greenland's independence from Denmark, remnants of the Danish garrison and civilians who consider themselves loyal to the Danish monarchy have launched a putsch against the government. As they storm the parliament, police are called to remove the putschists. However, if the putschists manage to get the Prime Minister to resign and the monarchy to be restored before the police arrive, then this act would be futile."
greenland_nato_crisis.3.a:0 "Our allegiance is to the republic, to democracy!"
greenland_nato_crisis.3.b:0 "We shall proclaim a new northern empire!"

greenland_nato_crisis.4.t:0 "New Elections"
greenland_nato_crisis.4.d:0 "As many still consider the results of the independence referendum to be called, along with the Social Democrats quitting the governing coalition, a new election has been called. \n\nOn one side, the Social Democrats advocate for a return to NATO and for Greenland to enter a personal union with Denmark. Many of the smaller parties have united around the Social Democrats in a bid to stop Inuit Ataqatigiit from completely transforming Greenland.\nOn the other side, Inuit Ataqatigiit advocates for a transition to socialism and to completely cut ties with Denmark.\n\nIn the end, only one can win."
greenland_nato_crisis.4.a:0 "The Social Democrats cruise to victory"
greenland_nato_crisis.4.b:0 "Inuit Ataqatigiit is given the mandate to govern"

greenland_nato_crisis.5.t:0 "The Crown Prince Ascends"
greenland_nato_crisis.5.d:0 "Given the recent political unrest in both Denmark and Greenland, as well as across the world in general, our queen has decided to abdicate for her health. The Crown-Prince will now become the King of Denmark, Greenland, and any other realm that may be seized in the future..."
greenland_nato_crisis.5.a:0 "Long live the King!"

greenland_nato_crisis.6.t:0 "Queen Margarethe of Denmark Abdicates"
greenland_nato_crisis.6.d:0 "After a long reign as queen, the Queen of Denmark has decided to abdicate due to the increasing political tension all around the world taking a toll on her health. She will be the first Danish monarch in over 900 years to voluntarily abdicate the throne. She will be remembered for her long reign through the Cold War and the new century."
greenland_nato_crisis.6.a:0 "Queen Elizabeth's death must have spooked her"

greenland_nato_crisis.7.t:0 "Monarchist Coup in Greenland!"
greenland_nato_crisis.7.d:0 "News out of Nuuk today reports that monarchists have seized control of the Greenlander government in a putsch supported by remnants of the Danish garrison! Greenland had recently left NATO and declared independence from Denmark in a referendum that many consider to be rigged. Interestingly, instead of installing a civilian government, the putschists have opted to install the Danish monarch as an absolute monarch in the aftermath of the putsch."
greenland_nato_crisis.7.a:0 "The true last monarchy of North America"

greenland_nato_crisis.8.t:0 "Monarchist Coup in Greenland!"
greenland_nato_crisis.8.d:0 "News out of Nuuk today shows reports of a failed putsch by monarchists and the remnants of a Danish garrison in Greenland! Greenland had recently left NATO and declared independence from Denmark in a referendum that many consider to be rigged, which had prompted the Social Democrats to leave the governing coalition risking a government collapse. Now more than ever, a no-confidence motion seems to be the most probable event. This prompted the Prime Minister to call for snap elections to decide the future of Greenland."
greenland_nato_crisis.8.a:0 "What of the royalists?"

greenland.1.t:0 "Americans in Greenland Make Contact"
greenland.1.d:0 "Ever since the American collapse, refugees have had safe harbor in Greenland. However, growing unrest at the far-left policies imposed upon them have created tensions. \n\nThese groups have contacted us in a plea for help. After the recent political tensions here have resolved, we now have the perfect agitator to send to Greenland to lead this cause."
greenland.1.a:0 "Trump Jr., have a great vacation! (Switch to Greenland)"
greenland.1.b:0 "Trump Jr., have a great vacation!"
greenland.1.c:0 "Uh, who are these losers?"

greenland.2.t:0 "The Integration of Greenland"
greenland.2.d:0 "After signing the proclamation, our king smiled. He knew that this wouldn't go down well with the locals, but an obstacle in a journey is meant to be a bump in the road, not a wall that blocks our path."
greenland.2.a:0 "Three Cheers for the Kingdom of Denmark!"

greenland.3.t:0 "The Danish Takeover of Greenland"
greenland.3.d:0 "In a surprise move, the Danish have just announced that Greenland will be fully integrated as a part of Denmark. This move comes after royalists couped the Greenlander government following a referendum on independence, which many to be rigged. This signals a growing militaristic trend in Denmark, and an unkown future."
greenland.3.a:0 "A new power enters the fray"

greenland.4.t:0 "The Seizure of the Virgin Islands"
greenland.4.d:0 "Early this morning, our forces reported in the successful capture of the Virgin Islands from the UN administration of Puerto Rico and other former American Caribbean territories.

greenland.6.t:0 "The Crisis in Canada"
greenland.6.d:0 "In recent months Canada has descended further and further into chaos as Justin Trudeau became increasingly more authoritarian. However, recent government violence against the protests in May have led to the secession of Quebec, triggering the collapse of the Canadian nation as we know it. \n\nThis presents NATO with an interesting choice: Should we intervene or not?\nTo convince the others, we along with our Danish brothers have decided to take up the burden of leading the NATO advance, hopefully buying enough votes. \n\nIn the end, the member nations of NATO voted..."
