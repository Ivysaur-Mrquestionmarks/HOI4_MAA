 fld.1.d:0 "Miami was in ruins. Smoke filled the air as police struggled to maintain control over a panicked populace. Years earlier, Jeb's Revolution was put down, making the area a virtual police state. After the sudden rise and fall of Jeb's second reign, the area was forgotten and saw a steep drop in population. Now, upon the brink of annihilation, Miami was held by a loosely strung together government led by the moderate Republican Francis X. Suarez. Suarez was no military mastermind but he knew how to speak to the masses. Soon his voice was playing over every single radio and TV in the area. \n\n"My fellow Floridians. We must during this trying time come together as one. The forces of evil and destruction lie at our gates and if we continue to fight, we will become only a distant memory in the pages of history. I need you all to fight for your civil liberties and freedoms you hold so dear, for the battle upcoming depends on it. In the coming weeks, you will be tested in your strength, mind, and soul, but take heart, for we hold the legitimate power in Florida. Long live Florida! Long live Democracy!"
