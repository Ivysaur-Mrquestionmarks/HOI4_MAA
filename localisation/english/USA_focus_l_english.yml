 USA_make_america_great_again_desc:0 "Once upon a time the United States of America was the greatest nation on Earth. It was renowned by every country, its people were happy, and it could project its power to any corner of the globe! But no longer is that the case. Thanks to the Democrats and their woke mob, the America our Founding Fathers wanted was replaced by something lesser. No longer was patriotism encouraged, instead the Democrats tried to turn the men and women of America into weak snowflakes who would bow to any foreign power, and who would be offended by just about anything.\n\nBut one man stood against the tide! Donald J. Trump would not simply stand by and watch the nation he loved be brought to its knees. His first presidency in 2016 was one of the most successful yet, and it really seemed he might save America. But thanks to the Chinese rigging the election to oust him, it seemed his work might all be for naught. Unwilling to see this happen, he rallied patriots everywhere and formed a rival government, a real government, a great government! Now America lies shattered, and President Trump is the only man who can truly put it back together!"
 USA_choose_a_vp:0 "Choose a Vice President"
 USA_choose_a_vp_desc:0 "Most of the world recognizes the Federal Republic of America as the legitimate successor to the USA, and there are several reasons for this. Firstly, Biden’s government seems more like a real government. While we are just as democratic as them, some aspects of our nation may seem a bit…dictatorial. Mainly is the fact that President Trump has no Vice President. Thanks to Mr. Pence’s betrayal, and the haste with which our new government was formed, there was simply no time to pick one. Now that the dust has settled onthe Good Friday Ceasefire, the time has come for him to make a decision."

 USA_mil_readiness2:0 "Train them"
 USA_mil_readiness2_desc:0 "There aren’t many soldiers in our labour units who are experts in their field, and this is a major problem. If they don’t know what they’re doing, their fortifications will be lackluster and easily overrun. We must gather the few experts we do have and put them in charge of training new recruits. Soon the labour units will be on par with the rest of our military!" 
 USA_mil_readiness3:0 "Expand them"
 USA_mil_readiness3:0 "Now that the soldiers and engineers within our labour units know what they’re doing, we can finally go about gathering more of them.
