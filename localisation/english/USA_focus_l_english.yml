 USA_military_reform_desc:0 "Several generals have come together to propose a plan on reforming our military. Reform is necessary, they say, because although it’s a hard pill to swallow we are not as powerful as we once were. As such we need to compensate for the loss of manpower and equipment.

 USA_doctrinal_reform:0 "Reform our doctrine"

 USA_transport_helis:0 "Air Assult Infantry"
 USA_transport_helis_desc:0 "After enemy ground forces have been weakened and their anti-air has been destroyed, air assault infantry is what comes next.

It was renowned by every country, its people were happy, and it could project its power to any corner of the globe! But no longer is that the case. Thanks to the Democrats and their woke mob, the America our Founding Fathers wanted was replaced by something lesser. No longer was patriotism encouraged, instead the Democrats tried to turn the men and women of America into weak snowflakes who would bow to any foreign power, and who would be offended by just about anything.\n\nBut one man stood against the tide! Donald J. Trump would not simply stand by and watch the nation he loved be brought to its knees. His first presidency in 2016 was one of the most successful yet, and it really seemed he might save America. But thanks to the Chinese rigging the election to oust him, it seemed his work might all be for naught. Unwilling to see this happen, he rallied patriots everywhere and formed a rival government, a real government, a great government! Now America lies shattered, and President Trump is the only man who can truly put it back together!"
 USA_choose_a_vp:0 "Choose a Vice President"
 USA_choose_a_vp_desc:0 "Most of the world recognizes the Federal Republic of America as the legitimate successor to the USA, and there are several reasons for this. Firstly, Biden’s government seems more like a real government. While we are just as democratic as them, some aspects of our nation may seem a bit…dictatorial. Mainly is the fact that President Trump has no Vice President. Thanks to Mr. Pence’s betrayal, and the haste with which our new government was formed, there was simply no time to pick one. Now that the dust has settled onthe Good Friday Ceasefire, the time has come for him to make a decision." 
 USA_rino_path:0 "Mike DeWine"
 USA_rino_path_desc:0 "Despite currently lacking control over the state of Ohio, former governor Mike DeWine has taken up refuge in Denver. He is an experienced politician who has worked with some of the greatest Republican presidents to ever grace the halls of the White House. He is favored by most moderates and even some conservatives, and his expert track record will surely help garner support. This is why President Trump has chosen him as his Vice President!" 
 USA_private_investments:0 "Talk With Private Corporations"
 USA_private_investments_desc:0 "With the instability in the USA right now, many corporations have been wary about investing or even doing business in America. DeWine has convinced President Trump that ensuring the support of corporations will greatly benefit us. President Trump did not need much talking down, as he himself is the owner of a wealthy business conglomerate. Not all corporations have been willing to strike a deal with us, but the ones that have will find that their investment has been well placed!" 
 USA_negotiate_with_corpos:0 "Strike a Deal With Northeastern Corporations"
 USA_negotiate_with_corpos_desc:0 "What better way to strike our rivals than by stealing their business? While we recover militarily, we can launch a different kind of preemptive strike.

 USA_integrate_ohio:0 "Bring in Mike's State"
 USA_integrate_ohio_desc:0 "The American Free State, currently in control of the state of Ohio, is laughably unstable. It is more akin to three children standing on top of each other wearing a trench coat than a functioning nation. Ohio is a valuable state in terms of industry and infrastructure, and while we may not be able to take it just yet, we can begin inserting agents and hijacking factories for our eventual takeover. " 
 USA_free_trade:0 "Open Up to Other Republicans"
 USA_free_trade_desc:0 "Despite the fact we only officially control some regions of the country, there are those loyal to us just about everywhere. Lots of Republicans have been forced to flee their homes thanks to patriotism being a prosecutable offense these days. They are flocking here by the droves, and welcoming them in will prove to be very beneficial." 
 USA_fruits_of_trade:0 "...And to Their Money"
 USA_fruits_of_trade_desc:0 "While this is not the case for all, many of the Republicans who were actually able to make it here are very well-off financially. These men and women will find it easier to establish themselves within the United States of America, so long as they invest a little in the war effort. Even those who aren’t so rich will be able to assist our noble cause by going to work in factories and fields across the nation!" 
 USA_align_republicans:0 "Expand the Loyalist"
 USA_align_republicans_desc:0 "While the loyalist faction of nations is few, there are still those hidden within other American successors and break-offs still loyal to us. Several of these groups are influential within their respective communities, and in some cases could even be considered their own nation. We will invite them to do business with us, while intentionally ignoring the nation they take up shelter in. " 
 USA_new_trade_routes:0 "Find New Routes to Our Allies"
 USA_new_trade_routes_desc:0 "Our allies are scattered across the continent, and we are separated by vast swaths of anarchy or woke hordes. If we are to maintain our position, we must secure trade routes to other loyalist nations. Once we are all strong economically, we will find becoming strong militarily to be a much easier feat." 
 USA_deradicalisation:0 "Fight Radicalisation"
 USA_deradicalisation_desc:0 "The radicalism of some branches of the Republican Party are bad for business. DeWine and Trump have had several conversations about the negative impacts that radical groups can have on the appearance of a nation. Thanks to some convincing from DeWine, President Trump has announced a campaign to remove some of the most radical elements from our democracy. How this goes, remains to be seen." 
 USA_expell_deradicals:0 "Eliminate The Proud Boys"
 USA_expell_deradicals_desc:0 "While President Trump is not too enthusiastic about this, it must be done. As of now the Proud Boys are doing nothing but terrorizing residents of our nation, and damaging our reputation abroad. Something must be done about them, and the simplest thing to do is to just get rid of them. While this may damage his own reputation to some people, it will really just show who the true patriots are." 
 USA_research_group:0 "Loyalist Research Efforts"
 USA_research_group_desc:0 "Most of the so-called “intellectuals” currently reside within the FRA. This isn’t to say there aren’t smart and capable scientists within our own nation, we must simply set out to find them. Soon the USA will be creating new and ingenious inventions by the day!" 
 USA_mil_industrial_complex:0 "Revive tbe Military Industrail Complex"
 USA_mil_industrial_complex_desc:0 "Despite Eisenhower’s warnings about the military industrial complex nearly 80 years ago, in reality it has proven to be very reliable. Large defense contractors were damaged extensively by the start of the Second American Civil War, but if we help them reestablish themselves we will surely reap the benefits. " 
 USA_embargo_FRA:0 "Restrict Trade With The demorats" #Intentional misspell
 USA_embargo_FRA_desc:0 "Shockingly, in some areas of the economy we still openly trade with the FEDS. To think they are stealing our resources and giving us their discounted, “pro-labour” goods is an atrocious idea. We will restrict, and in some cases, terminate trade with the FRA to ensure our goods stay in our hands." 
 USA_bring_new:0 "Host Resistance Radio"
 USA_bring_new_desc:0 "Host Resistance Radio: Resistance Radio has shown itself to be very capable of spreading Pro-Trump propaganda.

 USA_expand_minning:0 "Expand Minning Operations"
 USA_expand_minning_desc:0 "While the territory we control mainly consists of fields for natural resources, there are still plenty of ores and other materials below ground. This is America, after all! Mining was never really prioritized in the Great Plains under previous regimes, but we see its value. We need all the resources we can get, and there are plenty under our feet! " 
 USA_expand_minning2:0 "Mine More!"
 USA_expand_minning2_desc:0 "Our initial expansion of mining operations hasn’t been enough. Our factories are still struggling when it comes to sourcing raw materials. We need to mine more, to dig even deeper! We are standing on the secret to our success, and we will get it into our hands! " 
 USA_NEW_forts:0 "Fortify New England"
 USA_NEW_forts_desc:0 "While our holdings in New England are few, they are invaluable. Maine is the only New England state currently not occupied by the FRA, and once war resumes they will be an important front. We must help them dig in and ensure our friends in Maine do not fall."
 USA_loyalist_economic_coperation:0 "Invest in Our Allies"
 USA_loyalist_economic_coperation_desc:0 "Our allies are just as war torn as we are, and could do with a little investing. The money we send out to them will mainly be for their military, but they’re also free to spend some of it on infrastructure if they please." 
 USA_MAGA_path:0 "Ben Carson"
 USA_MAGA_path_desc:0 "Benjamin Carson is one of the few members of President Trump’s old cabinet still loyal to him. They’ve become close friends since the outbreak of the civil war, and have proven to work together quite well. As the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Carson will be invaluable in developing the lands currently controlled by the USA. This has landed him a place on the ticket as President Trump’s VP, and with luck they will continue to do great work together!" 
 USA_midwest_industrialisation:0 "Bring Back American Jobs"
 USA_midwest_industrialisation_desc:0 "Under the Demorats, jobs pioneered by Americans were ignored and people were encouraged to practice “the arts”. Real American jobs are ones like farmer, factory worker, and miner. The Democrats want our people to do nonsensical professions like software engineer, opinion writer, and improv comedian. If we are to make America great again, we need to bring back these great jobs! " 
 USA_midwest_industrialisation2:0 "More Jobs For America"
 USA_midwest_industrialisation2_desc:0 "Thanks to the Democrats, jobs for Americans were taken away and given to illegal aliens who flooded our border. Now that President Trump is in charge of the USA, albeit not all of it, he can ensure that jobs meant for Americans go to Americans. Not only this, but with Vice President Carson’s help even more new jobs can be created!" 
 USA_the_arms_industry:0 "Patriotic Jobs"
 USA_the_arms_industry_desc:0 "There are American jobs, and then there are patriotic jobs! While every job helps the economy, some actively help the nation as well. Some of these include the military, and anyone in government. These men and women are doing God’s work, and their duty to their nation!" 
 USA_industrial_subsedies:0 "Subsedise American Industry"
 USA_industrial_subsedies_desc:0 "Many corporations are struggling to establish themselves within the USA, and this isn’t good for business. Vice President Carson has started a campaign to subsidize industry in an attempt to get manufacturing companies to set up shop. This will be a win-win for both of us, as we get more money and jobs for the people, and they get more goods produced at a cheaper price."

 USA_celebrate_our_achivement_desc:0 "We have come far in a short period of time, and both President Trump and Vice President Carson have agreed celebrations are in order.

Things must go smoothly, I mean, how badly off plan could it possibly go? " 
 USA_continue_the_plan:0 "Continue the Industrial Plan"
 USA_continue_the_plan_desc:0 "Well that party was certainly interesting. Despite Trump Jr.’s drunken ramblings and proclamations, as of now the industrial bill is going forwards according to plan. Junior does not have as much power as he would like to believe, and unless President Trump listens to him, God knows why he would, thinks should go forth uninterrupted. There is still much work to do, and we will do it!" 
 USA_the_critic:0 "The Critic"
 USA_the_critic_desc:0 "Trump Jr. has continuously been a thorn in Vice President Carson’s side. Not to disrespect President Trump, but his love for his son often causes him to favor him blindly. Junior is not a very intelligent man, yet he has somehow garnered a significant support base. He has been a heavy critic of the infrastructure and industrial bills, and now it seems President Trump may be beginning to listen to him."

 USA_the_counter_proposal_desc:0 "Trump Jr. has come out of nowhere with his own counter proposal to Vice President Carson’s infrastructure bill. Why?

 USA_his_project:0 "The Son's Projects"
 USA_his_project_desc:0 "Trump Jr. has begun his projects under his own infrastructure bill. It is nowhere near as organized as Carson’s and seems like it will do nothing but waste funds. However the Vice President can’t call Junior out on this, lest he risk losing Trump Sr.’s favor." 
 USA_another_disputed_project:0 "Another Dispute"
 USA_another_disputed_project_desc:0 "Vice President Carson can’t let this go on any longer. His hard work is being ruined simply because he is not the President’s son.

 USA_infrastructure_plan:0 "The Infrastructure Plan"
 USA_infrastructure_plan_desc:0 "Now that our industrial might has been expanded, the time has come to turn our attention towards the nation’s infrastructure. The territory currently controlled by the USA is mostly rural and sparsely populated outside of cities, and so many roads and bridges are outdated.

 USA_fuel_storage:0 "Expand Fuel Storage"
 USA_fuel_storage_desc:0 "The fact that we have gotten to the point that we need to expand fuel storage simply shows how far we’ve come. In the initial days after the Good Friday Ceasefire fuel was scarce, and now we have too much! New silos and other storage depots will be constructed to keep our abundant fuel reserves safe. " 
 USA_reivest_the_profits:0 "Reinvest the Profits"

 USA_infrastructure_carson_desc:0 "Vice President Carson has proposed his infrastructure bill, and it has passed with immense support!

 USA_the_request:0 "Carson's Request"
 USA_the_request_desc:0 "Trump Jr. has been nagging Vice President Carson for some time. He has done everything he can to constantly undermine Carson’s efforts, and for what? Tomorrow President Trump and Carson will meet, and the latter intends to request the President to control his son. How Trump will respond is uncertain, but Carson sincerely hopes his response will favor him." 
 USA_the_plot:0 "The Plot"
 USA_the_plot_desc:0 "Vice President Carson is unfit for government, and no one knows this better than Junior. Political dynasties are a thing, right? So by that logic, someone related to Trump should be his Vice President. Carson clearly isn’t related to Trump, but guess who is? Trump Jr!" 
 USA_the_scandal:0 "The Scandal"
 USA_the_scandal_desc:0 "Ben Carson is a respected man within the Trump administration, and so sabotaging him will be hard. Luckily, during a recent speech he said some words that could be easily twisted.

 USA_the_after_math:0 "The Aftermath"
 USA_the_after_math_desc:0 "Trump Jr.’s fabricated scandal worked incredibly well, better than he even expected. Half the country started believing Carson was secretly a communist, and even President Trump got on the rumor train. Former Vice President Carson resigned out of shame, and while it might’ve made Junior feel a little bad, it was for the best."

 USA_prevent_another_fuck_up_desc:0 "Thankfully, President Trump has been cooperative and sees the threat his son poses to the betterment of our nation. While of course no official action will be taken against Junior, his father has pulled some strings to make sure he won’t be a problem anymore." 
 USA_increase_oversight:0 "Increase Oversight"
 USA_increase_oversight_desc:0 "As the scope of the infrastructure bill expands, it becomes more of a burden to oversee everything.

Oversight must be expanded to ensure nothing like this happens, communists have no place in America!" 
 USA_Continue_the_plan:0 "The Plan Continues"
 USA_Continue_the_plan_desc:0 "We are now entering the second stage of the infrastructure bill, and things are continuing to go smoothly! Junior isn’t a problem anymore, any potential unions have been weeded out, and the profits just don’t stop! Now Carson can turn his gaze back inward, and sort out all the “problems” within the administration."

 USA_invest_in_electronics_desc:0 "Silicon Valley in California was once the main innovation hub of America, but now that it’s under the control of the communists we must form a new one.

 USA_fire_unloyal_party_members_desc:0 "There are those within the current administration who do not support Carson and President Trump.

They have tried to sabotage us before, and now we must fire them to make sure they don’t try again. " 
 USA_sideline_rinos:0 "Control who Gets Promoted"
 USA_sideline_rinos_desc:0 "It’s a shame traitors were able to ascend to the upper echelons of our government in the first place, and it will not happen again. Not just had they found their way into government positions, but also influential positions elsewhere. If we control who gets promoted, we can ensure they don’t harbor dangerous ideas, and that they too want what’s best for the nation. " 
 USA_Patriots_in_control:0 "Patriots in Control"
 USA_Patriots_in_control_desc:0 "America is great again! While it still lies fractured, the land controlled by true patriots is in better condition than ever.

 USA_a_new_VP_desc:0 "With Ben Carson out of the picture, Trump Jr. has finally got his chance. He managed to convince President Trump to select him as his new VP, a dream come true.

 USA_empower_the_trump_family_desc:0 "The Trump Family is possibly the greatest to ever come out of America. Only they know what is right for the nation, and will lead it to a bright future.

 USA_trump_jr_and_his_projects:0 "Give Him Control Over Industrial Policy"
 USA_trump_jr_and_his_projects_desc:0 "Carson, communist as he was, had some genuinely decent ideas for managing industrial policy.

 USA_family_and_goberment:0 "Family and Goverment"
 USA_family_and_goberment:0 "Many of the most successful regimes in history were so successful because they were ruled by one family. Families know each other, and work very well together.

 USA_cult_of_personality:0 "The Cult of Trump"
 USA_cult_of_personality_desc:0 "Too many, a cult of personality sounds like a bad thing. However, it really isn’t. When a leader has a cult of personality, they manage to lead their nation much more successfully. When America’s leader is someone as great as President Trump, a cult of personality is a necessity so he can bring forth his vision for our great nation!"

 USA_the_true_struggle_desc:0 "Now that the Trumps firmly sit atop the territory they control, they can begin preparations for a great crusade. A crusade against the traitorous Democrats, who broke the USA! In a way though, Trump Jr. must thank them, for they gave him the opportunity to reform the government. Soon America will be whole again, an America ruled by the Trumps!" 
 USA_the_trump_legion:0 "The Trump Legion"
 USA_the_trump_legion_desc:0 "Behind President Trump is his supportive family. They are his legion, defending him no matter where he goes.

Now that they occupy many important government positions, anything Trump wants done will be done. For the United States of America, and President Trump!" 
 USA_PB_path:0 "gavin mcinnes"
 USA_PB_path_desc:0 "If President Trump wants to be able to lead the USA with the utmost efficiency, he needs a VP who will not question his decisions. Gavin McInnes, founder of the Proud Boys, has shown himself time and time again to be a true patriot. McInnes was one of the first to oppose the woke agenda and bringing him into the administration will also bring in the Proud Boys. Of the three choices for Vice President, McInnes has the most to offer, and least to take."
 USA_railroads:0 "Railroad Projects"
 USA_railroads_desc:0 "For a long time the heart of America was its railroads. In the past century, trucking has slowly begun to replace trains, but has not made them obsolete.

 USA_build_up_arms:0 "A Patriotic Arms Industry"
 USA_build_up_arms_desc:0 "With the outbreak of the Second American Civil War, many defense contractors began supplying both sides. While this worked in the short term, we can no longer associate ourselves with companies that work with the Democrats. Either they can choose us, or them. Soon the arms industry will be controlled by patriots, and every gun will go to a true believer!" 
 USA_war_policy:0 "Prepare for Total War"
 USA_war_policy_desc:0 "Sooner than later the Good Friday Ceasefire will expire, and the drums of war will beat again. When this war comes, we will not simply engage in hit and runs and insurrections, we will fight total war. We need tanks, guns, planes, all of this and more. When the time comes for our soldiers to march, the Democrats will be overwhelmed and destroyed!" 
 USA_closed_economy:0 "Close the Economy"
 USA_closed_economy_desc:0 "If our economy relies too much on a single foreign entity, we will struggle to fight a war. The USA has plenty of natural resources, and as such we don’t need to rely on anyone but ourselves. With our economy closed, nations more friendly to the woke left will no longer be able to play with us!" 
 USA_underground_factories:0 "Hide our Factories"
 USA_underground_factories_desc:0 "Our factories as they currently stand are incredibly easy targets for missiles and bombers. Our Air Force will not be able to defend them all from the forces of the feds, and so we must ensure they cannot be found. Keep them secret, keep them safe." 
 USA_bomb_proof_factories:0 "Bomb Proof the Rest"
 USA_bomb_proof_factories_desc:0 "Not all of our factories can be easily hidden, and so we must begin bombproofing those we cannot disguise. We will ensure they are built and reinforced with sturdy materials, and protected with the best AA the USA has to offer." 
 USA_mil_readiness1:0 "Labour Units"
 USA_mil_readiness1_desc:0 "A drastically overlooked segment of the army in the early days of our buildup were the labour units. These men and women are among the most important, ensuring that the land we take back stays under our control. Our army’s current labour force is understaffed and lacks equipment, something that will not do if we are to take back America!" 
 USA_mil_readiness2:0 "Train them"
 USA_mil_readiness2_desc:0 "There aren’t many soldiers in our labour units who are experts in their field, and this is a major problem. If they don’t know what they’re doing, their fortifications will be lackluster and easily overrun. We must gather the few experts we do have and put them in charge of training new recruits. Soon the labour units will be on par with the rest of our military!" 
 USA_mil_readiness3:0 "Expand them"
 USA_mil_readiness3:0 "Now that the soldiers and engineers within our labour units know what they’re doing, we can finally go about gathering more of them. The force is still small, despite minor expansions, and more manpower is needed. Any true patriot should be willing to work anywhere in the army, and so there should be no problems with being assigned to build bunkers and bridges." 
 USA_the_PB_paramilitary:0 "A Second Army"
 USA_the_PB_paramilitary:0 "While our armed forces continue to prepare for conflict with the Federal Republic of America, we can turn our attention to our less “official” army. The Proud Boys, a far right-wing militia founded by Vice President McInnes. Unlike our army which resides only within the territories under our control, the Proud Boys have several sects outside our borders. We must ensure they are properly utilized when we march to reunite America!" 
 USA_iron_fist:0 "Our Iron Fist"
 USA_iron_fist_desc:0 "The armed forces of the USA must be seen as dignified and respectable, however the Proud Boys don’t need the same levels of accountability. The FRA has them classified as a terrorist group, and so why change anything? Terrorists are what we need them to be, capable of striking deep into enemy territory even in times of peace. They will be our silent, iron fist, and they will be regarded as heroes!" 
 USA_Expand_PB_influence:0 "Expand their Scope"
 USA_Expand_PB_influence_desc:0 "The Proud Boys units outside of our borders are often disunited and out of contact with their leaders. While they still work to further our goals, without functional communication we can’t give them orders. To expand the scope of the Proud Boys we must find ways to get in contact with those of them behind enemy lines. Once they’re receiving new orders, we can move on to the next part of our plan." 
 USA_Expand_PB_militias:0 "Train More Proud Boy Units"
 USA_Expand_PB_militias_desc:0 "There will always be those who are a little too “cuckoo” for regular military service. Usually they would be disregarded by their government and sent to do some other job. However the Proud Boys have use for them. They need all the manpower they can get, and so these failed soldiers who probably shouldn’t be given firearms will be permitted to join them!" 
 USA_train_PB:0 "Larger Proud Boy Units"
 USA_train_PB_desc:0 "Now that we have more Proud Boys, we can begin to expand the size of their units. Until now they’ve been kept small but organized to maintain secrecy and keep a low profile. However there are plenty of areas where they can be expanded to wreak more havoc upon our foes!" 
 USA_heavy_weapons_PB:0 "Give Them Heavy Weapons"
 USA_heavy_weapons_PB_desc:0 "Up until recently the Proud Boys have had no need for heavy weaponry as the majority of their operations were things like hit and runs and convoy raids. However as their size increases, they’ve been finding themselves fighting against trained military forces more and more often. They are in desperate need of heavy weaponry to combat such threats, and to ensure their mission is successful." 
 USA_limit_PB:0 "Put Limits on The Proud Boys"
 USA_limit_PB_desc:0 "While they are loyal to us, there are times when the Proud Boys can be too radical. We must keep up the myth that we are not directly funding them, even if everyone knows we are, officially we aren’t. If they’re seen getting too much control, it will be obvious we’re their supplier. It is paramount we place limits on them to stop them from going too crazy." 
 USA_retake_control_from_PB:0 "Retake Control"
 USA_retake_control_from_PB_desc:0 "Despite McInnes founding the Proud Boys, he took a more hands-off approach after that, even giving up leadership. This has led to most units of the Proud Boys not actually being under our control, and only listening to our orders unofficially. With the recent limits placed on them, their dislike of us has grown, and we must wrangle them back under our control to make sure they don’t try anything funny." 
 USA_work_with_the_opposition:0 "Reinstate the Opposition"
 USA_work_with_the_opposition_desc:0 "No matter how much we need the Proud Boys, we cannot become dependent on them. If they manage to gain too much power our nation is doomed. To combat this, in a highly secretive move, several opposition groups to the Proud Boys have been founded or brought in. This is a conspiracy of the highest level, in fact it’s questionable if the President even knows. However it’s a necessary step to take in ensuring we stay in charge." 
 USA_make_america_again:0 "Make America Again"
 USA_make_america_again_desc:0 "We currently face a serious dilemma. How can we make America great again, when we don’t control all of it? Since the fake president, Joe Biden, formed his own illegitimate regime, our great nation has fractured. Between us and the Federal Republic lie a slurry of breakaway nations and even less legitimate successors. If we are to truly bring freedom and patriotism back to the USA, we must control it all!" 
 USA_western_direction:0 "Western Direction"
 USA_western_direction_desc:0 "The western United States was once known as the “Wild West”, and for good purpose. Today that name can once again be applied to the absolute anarchy the Rockies and Pacific have devolved into. Every ideology under the sun has found a place to fester and grow, from communism to facism, and it must be brought to an end! The West must be reigned back under our control, to the Pacific we shall go!" 
 USA_deal_with_devil:0 "Deal With the Devil"
 USA_deal_with_devil_desc:0 "As it currently stands, a war against California would be a long and brutal one. We would win in the end, but we would risk weakening ourselves to the point of being unable to take on the FRA. As much as it pains us, coming to some sort of agreement with Sanders is the best option. Trump and Sanders will carve up the west into their own spheres of influence. Someday we will strike down California, but that day is not today." 
 USA_IDA_PRA_deal:0 "Expand the Scope of the deal"

 USA_end_socialism:0 "End Communism"
 USA_end_socialism_desc:0 "The fact that an ideology such as communism can even find a place on our shores shows how far we’ve fallen as a nation. California, under the control of that rat Bernie Sanders, has become a puppet of the PRC. We can’t let their false successor last any longer." 
 USA_arm_the_coalition:0 "Arm anti Communist"
 USA_arm_the_coalition_desc:0 "Luckily, we aren’t the only people who hate communism. Just about every other breakaway nation in the west is anti-communist, and with a bit of coaxing would surely be willing to fight California. However they need weapons, weapons we can provide. We will arm them to ensure our progress towards a common goal."

 USA_red_war_desc:0 "The negotiations have been held, the secret meetings discussed, and the time is now. We will stamp this putrid state from the face of our nation with the support of the entire west. If we all work together, we can drive the People’s Republic from our shores! !" 
 USA_MON_conflict:0 "Push Montana west"
 USA_MON_conflict_desc:0 "Montana has been a stable red state for many years, but the fact they would opt for independence rather than joining us tells us everything we need to know about them. We will force them to hand over their eastern lands, in exchange for peace." 
 USA_MON_invade:0 "Invade Montana"

 USA_southern_border_adjustment:0 "Our Currenr Expansion Goals"
 USA_southern_border_adjustment_desc:0 "The South offers prime territory for expansion, but it's best to take it slow.

 USA_southern_forts_desc:0 "Oklahoma is a vast yet empty state, and as such is incredibly challenging to defend.

As such we should invest in proper defenses to ensure continued control over the southern plains." 
 USA_aid_FLO:0 "Invest into the Defense of Florida"

They have tried to brainwash our children into believing that there are more than two genders. Even the implications of this are simply disgusting, and trials will be held for major democrats. While we can’t yet prosecute them, the time will come." 
 USA_trial_for_treason:0 "Trial for Treason"
 USA_trial_for_treason_desc:0 "Another major offense many Democrats have partaken in is treason. They have explicitly tried to weaken our nation so that it could be taken over by foreign powers of the migrant mobs swarming over the southern border. Treason has always been one of the highest crimes in any civilized nation, and so trials will be held." 
 USA_trial_for_cheating:0 "Trial for Cheating"
 USA_trial_for_cheating_desc:0 "Another major offense the Democrats have partaken in that has even affected President Trump personally is cheating. Mainly, elections. Almost all recent elections where a Democrat has won has been rigged by the Chinese to give them an unfair advantage. Cheating should not be allowed in elections, and so trials will be held."
 USA_send_agents:0 "Send a Hitman"
 USA_send_agents_desc:0 "While it won’t be easy, we need to infiltrate the ranks of the Federal Republic. Once we’ve done this, we can kinapt the federal lidership. Soon the time will come for the Democrats to be prosecuted!" 
 USA_actual_trial:0 "The Real Trial"
 USA_actual_trial_desc:0 "Now that we control the Federal Republic of America, the last bastion of wokeness is gone. Most major Democratic Party members are now in custody, and the few who disappeared will be tracked down soon. President Trump has announced plans to personally oversee the trials against his rivals, to make sure their punishments are proportional to their crimes." 
 USA_actual_trial_degeneracy:0 "Trial for Degeneracy"
 USA_actual_trial_degeneracy_desc:0 "Degeneracy is not an executable offense, but many who are found guilty of it will be imprisoned for life. The degenerates among the Democrats must now be allowed to return to society, lest they ever attempt to brainwash a new generation of patriot Americans." 
 USA_actual_trial_treason:0 "Trial for Treason"
 USA_actual_trial_treason_desc:0 "Treason, unlike degeneracy and cheating, is an executable offense. While all Democrats are technically guilty of treason, we can’t be seen executing dozens if not hundreds of politicians. As such only the highest ranking members of the Democratic Party will be executed, and hopefully a message will be sent." 
 USA_actual_trial_cheating:0 "Trial for Cheating"
 USA_actual_trial_cheating_desc:0 "While the Democrats themselves didn’t rig the elections, the Chinese did that, they certainly knew and assisted them. As such their punishments will be slightly lesser, but they will probably end up spending the rest of their lives in prison. From now on all elections will be free and fair!" 
 USA_final_veredict:0 "The Final Veredict"
 USA_final_veredict_desc:0 "Now that the trials have finished, the final verdicts can be handed down. Almost every Democrat has been found guilty of some offense, the only ones who haven’t being the ones who snitched in exchange for freedom. Now that our only real rivals are gone, the plan to rebuild the political system can finally begin!" 
 USA_democrat_question:0 "The democrat Question"
 USA_democrat_question_desc:0 "Despite most real Democrats being imprisoned or executed, some sleazy politicians escaped punishment. They and some moderate Republicans have advocated for the Democratic Party to be restored, but more akin to the Democrats of 60 years ago. The only other real option is to make the Libertarians the main Republican opposition. President Trump must now internally debate on which option is best for the nation." 
 USA_reform_democrats:0 "Reform the Democrats"
 USA_reform_democrats_desc:0 "The status quo exists for a reason, and messing it up might have dire consequences. While the Democrats of today want to hurt America and sell it out to foreign rivals, the Democratic Party of old actually cares about its country. Before there was such a thing as wokeness and LGBTQ, we could actually peacefully interact and work with Democrats. We will bring their party back, but restore its former glory!" 
 USA_bring_southern_democrats:0 "Bring in Conservative Democrats"
 USA_bring_southern_democrats_desc:0 "A lot of the great Democrats of old came from the south. Dixiecrats, as they were called, were an important part of the old Democrats. When the progressives and communists seized the party, they shunned and chased out the Dixiecrats. Now that we’re once again in control, we can make sure these poor southern politicians have a better home." 
 USA_choose_a_new_democratic_candidate:0 "Hand pick a Democratic candidate"
 USA_choose_a_new_democratic_candidate_desc:0 "Now that the Democrats are people we can work with, we shouldn’t have to fear an election with them. Firstly, their candidate has slim chances of winning, and secondly, they won’t do anything to hurt us. The time has come to choose a new Democratic candidate, and hold new elections!" 
 USA_pardon_some_democrats:0 "Pardon some Democrats"
 USA_pardon_some_democrats_desc:0 "After the fall of the Federal Republic of America, some Democrats proved to be surprisingly cooperative. They had previously been outliers among their party, although still partially brainwashed. Now that they are free from the progressive’s yoke, they won’t cause us any problems. They will be pardoned and shall return to work in the New Democratic Party." 
 USA_let_them_campaign:0 "Allow Limted Democrat campaigning"
 USA_let_them_campaign_desc:0 "We can’t have the world screaming undemocratic at us, and so the Democrats will be allowed to campaign. While the chances are low that they will win, they still have a decently sized support base. No matter who wins, however, our agenda will continue to be pushed forward."
 USA_our_campaign:0 "Our Own campaign"
 USA_our_campaign_desc:0 "While sitting President Trump is popular, he can’t just magically win the election. A campaign must be held to show how great Trump is, and how great he would be if he were reelected! America is still recovering from the civil war, and so it can be made better! Great, even! Make America Great Again!" 
 USA_new_election:0 "New Elections"
 USA_new_election_desc:0 "The time has come. The ballots are open, the votes are rolling in, and the suspense is growing. Who will win the first elections of the re-United States of America? All we can do is wait and see, it’s a long way till November!" 
 USA_keep_them_under_watch:0 "Keep the new President Undwrwatch"
 USA_keep_them_under_watch_desc:0 "To the surprise of many, the Democratic candidate actually came out on top. It would seem the people are more tired of Trump than we thought. Nevertheless, their administration will not do anything to hurt us. They are just as loyal to our regime now as the other patriots. However, we must keep them under watch, just in case." 
 USA_trump_forever:0 "Trump Forever"
 USA_trump_forever_desc:0 "Coming as a surprise to very few, President Trump has secured another term. For the first time since 2020, he rules over an America that is whole. He can finally begin the long, arduous process of restoring the USA’s former greatness. America will be great, now, and forevermore!" 
 USA_a_new_face:0 "Step Down"
 USA_a_new_face_desc:0 "To the nation’s shock, President Trump has announced he will not be running for reelection. He has endorsed his Vice President, and has announced his plans to retire from politics once he has served his term. While this is sad news, it’s understandable. Trump is getting old, and he has done so much for our country! It’s only reasonable he would want to spend his golden years retired, in the nation he made." 
 USA_ban_democrats:0 "Ban the Democrats"
 USA_ban_democrats_desc:0 "If there’s one thing we’ve learned in the past few decades, it’s that the Democratic Party cannot be trusted. They are vermin, an infection of the political system. The only way forward is to cut the rot off at the source, and completely ban the Democratic Party!"
 USA_end_wokeness:0 "End Wokeness"
 USA_end_wokeness_desc:0 "Now that the wokes have been removed from the government, we can finally remove them from our country. Wokeness has done so much to hurt America, from starting a civil war, to brainwashing the youth, and killing hundreds. No more, we will end it once and for all!" 
 USA_republican_education:0 "Patriotic Party"
 USA_republican_education_desc:0 "The Democrats turned the education system into an amalgamation of filth and corruption. Now that we’re in control again, we can start to undo the damage done to schools. LGTBQ specifically will be banned in schools, and such degeneracy should not find its way into the minds of the youth! We will make sure that schools only teach true American values! Get rid of them" 
 USA_new_2_party:0 "A new 2 Party Sytem"
 USA_new_2_party_desc:0 "Modern politics within the USA have been dominated by the two “traditional parties” for years. However now that one of those parties is gone, we need to replace it, lest we appear as a dictatorship. The only two parties that could reasonably replace the Democrats are the Green and Libertarians. We shouldn’t have to explain why the Greens are absolutely not an option, and so that leaves the Libertarians." 
 USA_let_them_campaign_:0 "The Libertarian Campaign"
 USA_let_them_campaign__desc:0 "The time has come to allow the Libertarians to set forth and spread their wings! We have done the best we can, and have created a rival party we can truly be proud of! Sure, their chances of success are slim, as we want them to be. Regardless, no one can call us a dictatorship anymore!" 
 USA_GLA_reunification:0 "Reunify With the GLA"
 USA_GLA_reunification_desc:0 "The Great Lakes region throughout the Second American Civil War became something of an anomaly. The states of Wisconsin and Michigan were always flip floppy when it came to politics, but their fall to libertarianism was quite surprising. Regardless, now that we have the Libertarians as the second official major party, peaceful reunification should be possible." 
 USA_extend_period_of_exeption:0 "Extend the Period of Exeption"
 USA_extend_period_of_exeption_desc:0 "Despite the fact that the FRA has been subdued, there are still threats to our nation. As such the State of Exception must be extended, as the wisdom of our president knows no bounds. With his guidance, we will stomp out the last traces of evil within our great USA, and we will be one nation under god once more!" 
 USA_end_leftist_remains:0 "End leftist Remanants"
 USA_end_leftist_remains_desc:0 "Despite the fact we are now the undisputed successor to the United States of America, there are still traitors who resist the will of their nation! These Marxist scum hide in the shadows, and strike when we least expect it, acting as if this somehow makes them noble. We will show them who’s in charge when we hang them from the gallows!" 
 USA_america_first:0 "America First"
 USA_america_first_desc:0 "The United States of America is a great country, in fact, some might even say it’s the greatest. For this reason we must show the world we are a force to be reckoned with, and we aren’t giving out anymore freebies!" 
 USA_the_future_of_democracy:0 "The Future of Democracy"
 USA_the_future_of_democracy_desc:0 "There was a time when it seemed as though democracy would be struck down. Then, a hero emerged from the ashes, Donald J. Trump! Thanks to his Odyssey of patriotism and his noble deeds, the future of our great nation was safely secured! Now we can finally stop focusing on the present, and turn our gaze to the future, along with the greatness that is to come!"
