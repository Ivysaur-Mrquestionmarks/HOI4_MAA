He should, moreover, be in conduct wise and prudent, honest and temperate; in disposition gentle and compassionate; in behavior kind and courteous; cultivating the society of the good and avoiding the society of the evil. He should honour and study the Holy Scriptures, making them the rule of his belief and life; uphold and defend, by all legitimate means, the Protestant Faith in Church and State; protest against and oppose the erroneous and dangerous doctrines and practices of the Church of Rome; and resist the power, ascendancy, encroachments, and extension of that Church. He should also, by all lawful means, co-operate with true Protestants in preventing or removing in and from the Established and other Protestant Churches all changes, ceremonies, practices and ornaments savouring of or resembling the Church of Rome, or inconsistent with the Reformation principles. He should oppose the ascendancy and oppressions of non-Christian religions and by prayer and witness seek to lead their members from spiritual darkness into the light of Christ. He should by his general converse, indicate his veneration for the Name of God, and abhorrence of profane and indecent language; in short the Glory of God and love of man, the honour of his Protestant Sovereign, and the good of his country, should be the principles and motives of a true Orangeman's life and actions."
