 CRU_expand_oil_production:0 "Expand Oil Production"
 CRU_expand_oil_production_desc:0 "Trump’s war machine needs a more steady supply of oil, and Texas offers that. Patrick, working with the Barons, has pushed oil production and exports into overdrive. New drilling sites have also been erected to make sure the Big Man gets his black gold."

 CRU_embrace_minarchism_desc:0 "A large government isn’t truly necessary for a happy people. While the Libertarians don’t intend to completely end the government, they don’t have the power to do it anyways, they plan to cut smaller programs. The government should not overstep into the lives of the people!"
 CRU_deregulate_industries:0 "Deregulate Industries"
 CRU_deregulate_industries_desc:0 "Putting regulations on industries is practically communism! While not all regulations will be stripped, even the Libertarians expect a certain level of quality, many will be removed. For better or worse, we cannot yet say."
 CRU_a_free_texas:0 "A Free Texas"
 CRU_a_free_texas_desc:0 "No Texan should have to worry about the government coming to take their things. The only things Texans should have to worry about is themselves, their family, and their friends. The Texan market has been freed, and soon the people will be as free as a bird!"
 CRU_dont_tread_on_me:0 "Don't Tread On Texas"
 CRU_dont_tread_on_me_desc:0 "We know our rights! Texas is a free nation that will not bend to the likes of Trump or Biden. Don’t tread on us, but if you do, see where it gets you!"
 CRU_partner_with_big_business:0 "Partner With Big Business"
 CRU_partner_with_big_business_desc:0 "The Texan economy could use a bit of a boost, and how better to do this than partnering with corporations? There are plenty of companies who would be interested in investing in our young nation. Texas welcomes you!"
 CRU_utilize_nra_influence:0 "Utilize NRA Influence"
 CRU_utilize_nra_influence_desc:0 "Texans sure do love their guns, don’t they? The NRA holds more influence over Texas than ever before, and this can surely be used to further our agenda. In time the Texan government will be ours and ours alone!"
 CRU_a_corporate_senate:0 "A Corporate Senate"
 CRU_a_corporate_senate_desc:0 "To the surprise of many, the Texas Senate has been overrun with corporationists. No one knows what their plans for the country are, but they surely aren’t good. Where Texas goes from here is a mystery."
 CRU_a_christian_congress:0 "Christian Dominated Congress"
 CRU_a_christian_congress_desc:0 "The first Texan elections have seen its Congress filled with Christians. While some are worried this will not end well for many, others believe this is about as good as the Second Coming of Christ. Where Texas goes from here, is not for Governor Abbott to decide."
 CRU_christian_charity:0 "Christian Charity"
 CRU_christian_charity_desc:0 "One of the greatest things about Christianity is how charitable the religious can be. Texas may not be in the most dire straits anymore, but there are still people who need help. It has been decided to increase donations from the Texan government to Christian charities."
 CRU_build_more_churches:0 "Build More Churches"
 CRU_build_more_churches_desc:0 "Churches are places for people to come together as a community, not just to worship the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit. In order to help restore a sense of belonging among divided Texans, more churches will be built so they have a place to join hands in peace."
 CRU_end_secularism:0 "End Atheistic Thought"
 CRU_end_secularism_desc:0 "The idea that God does not exist makes many among the Texan government disgusted. The decision has been made to outright ban atheism, to ensure such heresy cannot spread!"
 CRU_ban_abortions:0 "Ban Abortions"
 CRU_ban_abortions_desc:0 "The issue of abortions has long plagued the Texan people, and now it is time to end the dispute once and for all. Ban it! Ban it all! No more abortions, no matter the circumstances!"
 CRU_in_texas_god_trusts:0 "In God Texans Trust"
 CRU_in_texas_god_trusts_desc:0 "Texas is now one nation under God, and the people know this. It has been proven time and time again that the most reliable thing on this Earth is our Lord and Savior. In God we trust!"
 CRU_fortress_texas:0 "Fortress Texas"
 CRU_fortress_texas_desc:0 "Any dreams of expansion have been shut down by Governor Abbott, they simply aren’t realistic. The former United States is incredibly vast, and we do not have the manpower or resources for expansion. Instead we must dig in, and ensure our nation can survive any onslaught."
 CRU_re_enact_conscription:0 "Introduce Conscription"
 CRU_re_enact_conscription_desc:0 "If we are to defend our nation we must make sure every able bodied man and woman can put up a fight. Many nations have mandatory conscription, all Texans over 18 must serve at least two years in the military! While they don’t all have to do it at once, it is required that they do."
 CRU_fortify_rio_grande:0 "Fortify Rio Grande"
 CRU_fortify_rio_grande_desc:0 "We cannot allow our southern flank to go undefended. Despite reinforcing it, we simply haven’t done enough. We must make sure that the Rio Grande is capable of protecting itself from the chaos of Mexico, and other other threat it may face."
 CRU_expand_military_budget:0 "Expand the Military Budget"
 CRU_expand_military_budget_desc:0 "Our military budget must be expanded if we are to truly defend our homeland. The United States once had a military budget larger than the other top eight militaries combined. While we can’t hope for that, maybe we can at least reach the top ten."
 CRU_enemies_everywhere:0 "Enemies Everywhere"
 CRU_enemies_everywhere_desc:0 "All around us there are those who look to assimilate us into their nation. The confederacy, Trump, the Nazis out west. We truly are alone in the world, but that doesn’t mean we must despair!"
 CRU_pardons_for_military_service:0 "Pardons for Military service"
 CRU_pardons_for_military_service_desc:0 "Criminals offer a large supply of manpower, and many would surely be willing to serve in exchange for a reduced sentence or pardon. While not all will have a chance to join, some criminals should never see the light of day again, most will have the opportunity to enter the armed forces."
 CRU_fortify_the_west:0 "Fortify the West"
 CRU_fortify_the_west_desc:0 "The west is quite empty, but just beyond our border lies a deadly threat. If the wannabe Nazis ever come knocking at our door, we must make sure they never are allowed in."
 CRU_fortify_the_north:0 "Fortify the North"
 CRU_fortify_the_north_desc:0 "Donald Trump is potentially the largest threat to the sovereignty of our nation. If he is able to reunite the continent, it will not be long before he comes for us. We must make sure he’ll never tread on Texas!"
 CRU_fortify_the_east:0 "Fortify the East"
 CRU_fortify_the_east_desc:0 "Despite all the internal conflicts of the confederacy, they still remain a threat. We will build a defensive line on our eastern flank, to make sure they never come for our people."
 CRU_the_dixie_collapse:0 "The Dixie Collapse"
 CRU_the_dixie_collapse_desc:0 "Our main rival in the south, the Second Confederacy, has fallen apart. With the death of their leader Kanye West, the nation has ripped itself apart. What happens now, remains to be seen."
 CRU_look_on_with_horror:0 "Look On with Horror"
 CRU_look_on_with_horror_desc:0 "Governor Abbott has decided that for now any intervention in the Confederacy is unreasonable. The nation is a mess, and trying to pick a side would be close to impossible. For now all we can do is sit and watch in horror as our eastern table rips itself apart."
 CRU_demand_UN_assistance:0 "Demand UN Assistance"
 CRU_demand_UN_assistance_desc:0 "Surely the United Nations would be happy to help with the humanitarian crisis happening to our east, right? Even if we aren’t a completely recognized member, they should still at the very least reply to our demands. Isn’t it their job to help people in need?"
 CRU_on_our_own:0 "On Our Own"
 CRU_on_our_own_desc:0 "After the UN has declined our plea for aid. it has become apparent that we are the only ones who can help the people of the Deep South. While Abbott doesn’t have a strong plan for our next steps, it seems like direct intervention is becoming more likely."
 CRU_denounce_radical_elements:0 "Denounce Radicals"
 CRU_denounce_radical_elements_desc:0 "Denouncing the radicals to our East is somewhat redundant, given that nearly every major faction is a radical group. Regardless, our criticism will surely be enough to at least partially lower their morale."
 CRU_invade_the_klan:0 "Invade the Klan"
 CRU_invade_the_klan_desc:0 "Almost everyone within Texas, and the world, agreed that the Klan is pretty bad. If we are to ensure that we don’t have a hostile nation to our east once the Confederacy is reunited, we must make sure we strike down the Klan. This should be an easy fight, as even the territory they do claim is not completely under their control."
 CRU_secure_new_orleans:0 "Secure New Orleans"
 CRU_secure_new_orleans_desc:0 "What exactly is going on in New Orleans is confusing, to say the least. It seems the city and surrounding areas have been taken over by the so-called Fabulous Republic. What makes their republic so fabulous, who knows? Either way the time has come to finally reunite Louisiana."
 CRU_the_western_csa:0 "The Western Confederacy"
 CRU_the_western_csa_desc:0 "Texas was once part of the original confederacy, and now that we control half their lands, we’re about as legitimate a successor as any. The decision has been to proclaim the formation of the Western Confederacy, obviously the only true successor."
 CRU_secure_louisiana:0 "Fortify Louisiana"
 CRU_secure_louisiana_desc:0 "The remains of the Confederacy are crawling with dangerous insurgents that could come over to our side of the border at any moment. We must turn our possessions in Louisiana into a fortress, capable of ensuring no insurgent is able to slip by unnoticed."
 CRU_set_up_refugee_camps:0 "Set Up Refugee Camps"
 CRU_set_up_refugee_camps_desc:0 "Our lands our east are being overrun by refugees from the Confederacy, and we will not turn them away. Governor Abbott has ordered the construction of refugee camps to ensure each and every one of the people crossing our eastern border has a home."
 CRU_request_border_patrol_and_national_guard_assistance:0 "Request National Guard Assistance"
 CRU_request_border_patrol_and_national_guard_assistance_desc:0 "The National Guard too has seen the chaos in the confederacy, and will probably be willing to help us. We will request their aid in patrolling our eastern border and managing refugees."
 CRU_deradicalize_migrants:0 "Deradicalize Migrants"
 CRU_deradicalize_migrants_desc:0 "While we welcome refugees from the east with open arms, many of them carry dangerous thoughts. Kanye’s confederacy was deeply radicalized and divided, and we will have no such dissent here. While the term reeducation camp is a somewhat negative one, ours will be nothing like those in China or North Korea!"
 CRU_create_new_jobs:0 "Create New Jobs"
 CRU_create_new_jobs_desc:0 "There is always opportunity in crisis, and in this one it’s the influx of able bodied people. These men and women will happily work for food and shelter, and who are we to turn away free manpower?"
 CRU_enlistment_for_citizenship:0 "Enlistment for Citizenship"
 CRU_enlistment_for_citizenship_desc:0 "The Texan Armed Forces are always looking for new members, and so these refugees are practically a godsend. In exchange for military service, the confederate migrants will be offered citizenship, and a place to stay for the duration of their service."
 CRU_our_comrades_in_dixie:0 "Our Comrades in Dixie"
 CRU_our_comrades_in_dixie_desc:0 "Sooner than later the Confederacy will be reunited, so we might as well make sure they do it on our terms. The Republic of New Dixie is the most legitimate successor state, and also the one that aligns with our ideology the most. We will help them win this war."
 CRU_send_volunteers:0 "Send Volunteers"
 CRU_send_volunteers_desc:0 "Plenty of Texans are eager to help our friends in Dixie reunite their nation, and who are we to stop them? We will begin sending these volunteers to the Dixie Republic to make sure they put that fighting spirit to good use."
 CRU_meet_with_brian_kemp:0 "Meet With Brian Kemp"
 CRU_meet_with_brian_kemp_desc:0 "Brian Kemp, the leader of the Republic of Dixie, has come to Texas on a diplomatic visit. He is here to meet with Governor Abbott to confirm our support for his nation. The visit so far has gone to plan, and Abbott is eager to meet with him!"
 CRU_the_defense_of_the_south:0 "Defense of the South"
 CRU_the_defense_of_the_south_desc:0 "Now that the war in Dixie is over, it is very pleasing to see Kemp’s triumph. However his nation has been laid to ruin, and would be quite an easy target for any external power. We will begin building a set of fortifications to ensure our new ally does not fall so quickly."
 CRU_a_catastrophic_defeat:0 "A Catastrophic Defeat"
 CRU_a_catastrophic_defeat_desc:0 "In an unfortunate turn of events, our allies in New Dixie have been struck down. With that our hope of the Confederacy being reunited under a friendly government have also been destroyed. How we proceed is now up to us."
 CRU_host_dixie_govt_in_exile:0 "Host the Dixie Government in Exile"
 CRU_host_dixie_govt_in_exile_desc:0 "Just before the Republic of Dixie fell, key government officials were evacuated to Dallas. Now that they’re here, we can go about helping them form a government in exile. Governor Abbott is proud to host them until they can reclaim their land."
 CRU_minor_positions:0 "Give Minor Positions"
 CRU_minor_positions_desc:0 "While we respect our allies in Dixie, they simply aren’t as good at running Texas as Texans are. As such they will be given less influential, minor roles within the Texan governmental machine. If they complain, they had better do well to remember who’s hosting them."
 CRU_major_positions:0 "Offer Major Positions"
 CRU_major_positions_desc:0 "The officials that were evacuated from Dixie were skilled at running their nation, and would be of much greater service in influential government positions. As such they will be offered major positions within the Texan government. However it’s still up to them to decide if they want to join or not."
 CRU_the_fourth_confederacy:0 "Declare the Fourth Confederacy"
 CRU_the_fourth_confederacy_desc:0 "Texas was once a key member of the Confederacy, and with the officials from New Dixie now working in our government, the time has come to invoke our heritage. We are proud members of the Fourth Confederacy of America!"
 CRU_war_of_reclamation:0 "The War of Reclamation"
 CRU_war_of_reclamation_desc:0 "The territories of the former Confederacy are ruled by a pretender regime, one we must strike down. We will reclaim the lands of the former Confederacy, all of them!"
 CRU_a_better_south:0 "A Better Dixie"
 CRU_a_better_south_desc:0 "The Confederacy under Kanye was corrupt and internal violence was widespread. If our nation is to survive indefinitely, we won’t allow ourselves to make the same mistakes as him. For a better Dixie, and a better future!"
 CRU_grander_ambitions:0 "Grand Ambition"
 CRU_grander_ambitions_desc:0 "While the lands of Kanye’s Confederacy have been brought back under our control, much of the original has not. In the 1860s the confederacy spanned from Arizona to Virginia. The time has come to reclaim everything that we’ve lost!"
 CRU_annex_florida:0 "Conquer the Peninsula"
 CRU_annex_florida_desc:0 "Our southern neighbor, Florida, has shown that independence doesn’t always solve problems. Their nation has been warped beyond anything that would ever have been possible in the old USA, and it’s time to put down Donald’s experiment and reclaim our territory!"
 CRU_into_appalachia:0 "Invade Appalachian Border States"
 CRU_into_appalachia_desc:0 "The region of Appalachia has seen some of the most radical groups of the Second American Civil War. These nations on our northern border are dangerous, and if they were ever allowed to expand the consequences would be disastrous. We will launch a preemptive invasion, to make sure they’re confined to the history books!"
 CRU_retake_virginia:0 "Retake Virginia"
 CRU_retake_virginia_desc:0 "Virginia is currently occupied by a puppet state of the Federal Republic of America. Legitimate successor to the USA or not, it’s our land, and we’re taking it back!"
 CRU_a_problem:0 "A Problem..."
 CRU_a_problem_desc:0 "Our old rival, the United States of America, is currently torn apart. In fact, just a few years ago we were no more than an illegitimate nation clinging to a few southern states. Now we’ve spread our wings, but they’ve spread far enough. We simply don’t have the resources or motivation to conquer the rest of the USA, and even if we were able to they would not accept our rule. Where we go from here, only God knows."
 CRU_presents_A_solution:0 "...A Solution..."
 CRU_presents_A_solution_desc:0 "It has been decided that the Confederacy will simply sit out the rest of the Second American Civil War. Our ancestors never claimed to want to conquer the USA then, so why should we now? We are our own nation, ready to blaze our own future. Who cares who reunites the USA, as long as they leave us alone."
 CRU_and_a_brighter_future:0 "...And a Bright Future"
 CRU_and_a_brighter_future_desc:0 "Until the USA is reunited, we don’t really have anything to worry about. Separatist militias have been quelled, radical violence is at an all time low, and the economy is growing. It seems that President Abbott may finally be able to step down and retire in peace. We’ll miss you, Greg Abbott!"
 CRU_ensure_rio_grande_loyalty:0 "Reinforce Rio Grande"
 CRU_ensure_rio_grande_loyalty_desc:0 "Our venture south of the border has become much more than that. The Rio Grande area has become our territory, and it must be defended. There are those who wish to pry it from us, and that must not be allowed to happen."
 CRU_manifest_destiny:0 "Manifest Destiny"
 CRU_manifest_destiny_desc:0 "In the 1800s there was the idea of Manifest Destiny. A theory that the United States of America should be able to expand across the continent, from sea to shining sea. Within Texas, our own desire for Manifest Destiny has been born. We must march beyond our borders, and bring order back to this shattered land."
 CRU_expand_rio_grande:0 "Expand Rio Grande"
 CRU_expand_rio_grande_desc:0 "Mexico is now a shattered nation, and its violence threatens to seep into our territory. We must march south and restore order to the country. Onwards!"
 CRU_end_nazi_scum:0 "End the Nazi Scum"
 CRU_end_nazi_scum_desc:0 "Just west of our borders lies cancer. Some Third Reich roleplayers have taken over vast swathes of the southwest. They cannot be allowed to continue and must be struck down before their rot spreads any further."
 CRU_march_our_boots_west:0 "March Our Boots West"
 CRU_march_our_boots_west_desc:0 "It has been decided that the west is a much better option to expand than the north. The west coast is hectic and its nations unstable. They will be easy targets for our strong Texan nation."
 CRU_march_our_boots_north:0 "March Our Boots North"
 CRU_march_our_boots_north_desc:0 "It has been decided that the north is our best option for expansion. While Trump’s USA may be formidable, it is a fight we believe we can win. After all, we have God on our side!"
 CRU_salt_lake_order:0 "Restructure the Salt Lake Region"
 CRU_salt_lake_order_desc:0 "Utah is currently perhaps the most unstable area of the former USA. The Mormons are tearing themselves apart, and we must not allow this violence to continue just outside of our borders."
 CRU_return_of_spencer_cox:0 "Return of Spencer Cox"
 CRU_return_of_spencer_cox_desc:0 "Spencer Cox and Governor Abbott have not always agreed on everything, but when it comes to the leadership of Utah, Cox knows what he’s doing. Now that we firmly control the territory, we can reinstate Cox as governor."
 CRU_travel_up_north:0 "Travel Up North"
 CRU_travel_up_north_desc:0 "Trump’s USA sits directly to our north, casting a shadow over the border. While Governor Abbott and Trump may have gotten along while America was still united, that is no longer the case. In the event of a Trump victory in the civil war, he will surely attempt to conquer Texas. We must carry out a preemptive strike!"
 CRU_show_them_true_libertarianism:0 "Show Them True Libertarianism"
 CRU_show_them_true_libertarianism_desc:0 "The Great Lakes region has come under the control of those who claim to be loyal to the constitution. While it’s nice that we’re not the only Libertarians left, they are simply not Libertarian enough. We will bring them under our control, and show them true libertarianism."
 CRU_union_of_the_great_plains:0 "Union of the Great Plains"
 CRU_union_of_the_great_plains_desc:0 "The vast open plains have finally fallen to our might. We are no longer simply Texas, but a nation encompassing all of the prairies. As such we will rename our nation to what it truly is, the Union of the Great Plains."
 CRU_our_destiny_manifested:0 "Our Manifested Destiny"
 CRU_our_destiny_manifested_desc:0 "Thanks to Governor Abbott our great nation has manifested its destiny! No longer are we confined to just Texas, but now control vast swaths of land as far as the eye can see. The people are content, and the nation happy!"
 CRU_integrate_south_rockies:0 "Integrate South Rockies"
 CRU_integrate_south_rockies_desc:0 "Our first step towards the west is the southern Rockies. These regions are chaotic and dangerous, and as such integration may prove challenging. However, it is for a great purpose and it must be done!"
 CRU_crush_ungodly_marxists:0 "Crush Western Marxists"
 CRU_crush_ungodly_marxists_desc:0 "California has been infected with communism, and we must treat the disease. China will not be pleased to see their puppet vanquished, but why should we care? America’s not for China!"
 CRU_march_down_northern_rockies:0 "March on the Northern Rockuies"
 CRU_march_down_northern_rockies_desc:0 "The northern Rockies are not as unstable as the south, but they are rural and vast. While conquering them may take some time, it shouldn’t be particularly difficult"
 CRU_a_western_repuiblic:0 "The Western Republic of America"
 CRU_a_western_repuiblic_desc:0 "No longer are we confined to just Texas, we have spread our wings across the western United States of America! However our intent was never to reunite the nation, and our desire for expansion has been quelled by the waves of the Pacific."

 alamo.1.t:0 "Terror Strikes the Capital"
 alamo.1.d:0 "Chaos and violence grip the once-peaceful streets of Austin, as clashes between monarchists and anti-monarchists spread to the outskirts of the city. Protests have become a normal part of life in the capital, with only a few violent incidents, however, this wave of terror has continued throughout the night. The emergency respondents have been overwhelmed, and it is unlikely that order can be established anytime soon. Reports are coming out that similar sparks have been witnessed in cities across the state, for more on this, we go to our Dallas report, Andrew Johnson.\n\n“Thank you, Mike, it appears that both Republicans and Democrats can agree on one thing, they refuse to be ruled by a King. Democratic protests continue to engage in gorilla terror attacks against local law enforcement, they have rallied around calls for freedom from oppression and that no one man should be above the law. On the other side, Republicans have engaged in more formal combat, with local militias combining forces to “liberate” their towns. Calls against a tyrannical government that collapses the liberty of others seem to be the spark for the right side of the political aisle. The capital government has already started mobilization of the military to tame this fire, though many question how effective such tactics could be, for as one Japanese military leader once said, “There is a rifle behind every blade of grass.” Only God knows of the terror that has become Texas, hold your children close tonight, because the morning may not come."

 alamo.3.t:0 "Midnight Broadcast"
 alamo.3.d:0 "Breaking news: a terrorist attack on a Fort Worth power plant has caused the entire city to suffer a major blackout. While this action was originally thought to be a one-off arsonist attack, similar attacks in Dallas, Houston, and Austin have caused major fears of anti-Trumpist attacks across the Texas plains. Our glorious leader Dan Patrick has reassured the public that no such uprising is happening, and that the situation is under control.\n\nHowever, reports are coming out that fierce combat between terrorist groups and militias has led others to doubt our leaders' words. Local law enforcement seems to be stretched thin, we even have reports of casualties stretching into the low hundreds. One can hope the Texan government is able to bottle up this conflict, but we can only hope that our great leaders are able to keep their heads about them. Get some rest tonight, for who knows what will come in the morning."
 alamo.3.a:0 "I'm sure everything's fine..."
 
 alamo.4.t:0 "This Seems Familiar"
 alamo.4.d:0 "Terror and panic strike the Texas state capital building, as hundreds of Anti-O’Rourke supporters have overtaken capital grounds. State representatives were successfully evacuated, but the building was taken. In the aftermath, President Beto O'Rourke took center stage and gave a rallying speech to his supporters across the Lone Star State.\n\n“To all those who rage against totalitarianism, to those who refuse to be oppressed, to those who want to break their chains, I call you now to protect what all true Texans hold in their hearts. We will not be relegated to second class citizens by those who seek the end of democracy. One truth we must hold onto is that all are created equal under the eyes of God. The fight ahead will be a long night, but we must not let that deter us, for after this long night comes a bright new morning.”\n\nThese words seem to have fallen on death ears as many local militias and leaders have taken up arms to establish their own claims to Texan land. All of Texas is engulfed in war, with many local governments proclaiming martial law. Good luck to all our listeners, this is your news channel Local 58, signing off for maybe the last time in a long time."

 #Hornberger's Folly
 
 alamo.5.t:0 "Libertarian Countercoup"
 alamo.5.d:0 "Miller's enthusiasm for implementing his reforms before properly securing the state has been his downfall. By failing to properly implement state security services, Libertarian activists have been able to organise resistance.\n\nToday, a massive march of Libertarians spearheaded by Jacob Hornberger stormed the State Capitol and overthrew the Free Texan Army. President Miller is missing, presumed dead."
 alamo.5.a:0 "We have a lot of fixing to do."
 
 alamo.6.t:0 "Bandits in the North"
 alamo.6.d:0 "Following the coup and subsequent countercoup, Texas has fallen into a bit of chaos, especially in the North. We are now hearing reports of organised bandits forming their own little army, harassing local settlements and kicking out elements of the rightful rule of law."
 alamo.6.a:0 "Not brilliant, but we can handle some bandits."
 alamo.6.b:0 "It's time to take advantage of this chaos."
 
 alamo.7.t:0 "Crenshaw Departs for the North"

 alamo.7.a:0 "Good luck, Daniel!"
 alamo.7.b:0 "Direct control of this operation is necessary."
 
 alamo.8.t:0 "New Mexico Declares Independence"
 alamo.8.d:0 "Citing our inability to stabilise the region, New Mexico has decided to cede from our occupation and go their own way. We don't exactly sit in a situation where we're able to stop them."
 alamo.8.a:0 "Everything's fine, they have the right to do that."
 alamo.8.b:0 "I'd rather be over there right now..."
 
 alamo.9.t:0 "El Paso Declares the Reconquista"

 alamo.9.a:0 "Uhh..."
 alamo.9.b:0 "¡Una, Grande y Libre!"
 
 alamo.10.t:0 "The Red Army"
 alamo.10.d:0 "The Communist Party of Texas has organised a broad front of Liberals, Progressives and fellow Communists, as well as a few remaining FTA cells, to rise up in the South. Luckily, their attention is currently turned towards the Falangists, who they deem a greater threat."
 alamo.10.a:0 "Urmmm...."

 alamo.11.t:0 "The FTA Strikes Back!"
 alamo.11.d:0 "Daniel Miller's Free Texan Army had been reorganising this entire time! Now they are prepared, they have launched an uprising in the West of the country!"
 alamo.11.a:0 "Miller? I thought he was dead!"
 alamo.11.b:0 "We must free Texas, at all costs."
 alamo.11.c:0 "Can we just.. not do this anymore..."
 
 alamo.12.t:0 "O'Rourke Denounces the Government"
 alamo.12.d:0 "Beto O'Rourke, posterchild for the Texas Democrats, has openly denounced our government as incapable to rule, and has consolidated control in three of Texas' most important cities! He's going to be tricky to uproot!\n\nHowever, Ted Cruz organised a populist rebellion and secured a large swathe of the country. Beto and Ted now face off."
 alamo.12.a:0 "Who to root for? They're both awful!"
 alamo.12.b:0 "Beto provides an opportunity to to restore sanity in Texas!"
 alamo.12.c:0 "We had some semblance stability with Cruz..."
 
 alamo.13.t:0 "An Offer from the Remnant"
 alamo.13.d:0 "The remnants of Hornberger's Libertarian Government have come to us with an... interesting offer."
 alamo.13.a:0 "For the future of Texas, we accept."
 alamo.13.b:0 "We want more autonomy."
 alamo.13.c:0 "How about NO!"

 alamo.17.t:0 "Texas Descends into Chaos!"
 alamo.17.d:0 "Nearly a week after the libertarian Texan Jacob Hornberger couped the radical Texan government, news of revolts and secession have come out of Texas. With nearly every single ideology group, from the far left, to the far right, to anarchists, and those loyal to Jacob Hornberger, it seems that Texas, one of the most populous and economically powerful warlords, has truly collapsed."
