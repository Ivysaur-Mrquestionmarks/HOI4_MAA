 DESC_LEADER_VERMIN_SUPREME:0 "Vermin Supreme's story is an odd one, and one that nobody would have believed but half a year ago. Becoming one third of the American Free State’s Triumvirate and leading a successful revolt from the G.L.A.R. probably wasn’t on his 2021 to-do list. But these are strange times, and sometimes strange times yield strange circumstances. In any case, Vermin Supreme found himself locked in a balancing act with the Triumvirate’s two other members.\n\nVermin also finds himself as the recognized “spokesman” of the Triumvirate due to AOC and Mattis seeing him as the least likely to be a threat, but Vermin isn’t a complete fool. He dreams of a truly free America, free from useless government bureaucracy, and he trusts neither Mattis nor AOC to deliver on that dream.\n\nSo Vermin Supreme, alone, walks his path towards his idea of true liberty for the people of the AFS. He knows things cannot go on forever like this, but his followers have put their faith in him.\n\nIn Supreme We Trust."

 DESC_LEADER_SAM_BROWN:0 "A man dedicated to duty and his country, Sam Brown was raised in a small town in Arkansas, and was accepted into the U.S. Military Academy at West Point one month after the attacks on September 11, 2001. Brown would graduate from the academy in 2006, and be commissioned as an infantry officer, and later achieving the designation of Airborne Ranger. Brown would be deployed to Kandahar, Afghanistan in 2008 where only a few months into his deployment, his vehicle was struck by an I.E.D. After being rescued from the wreckage, Brown would spend the next three years recovering from his injuries before being discharged in 2011. In the years since then, Brown and his family would move to Reno, Nevada and start a small business dedicated to helping out veterans. When the civil war began, and socialist forces swept through Nevada, Brown would take action and gather an elite group of soldiers, to resist the red tide from the west."

 DESC_LEADER_JAMES_MASON:0 "James Mason once said, "The Nazis cannot take power as long as the existing U.S. government remains in place."  Born in Chillicothe, Ohio, Mason grew fantasized with far-right and Neo-Nazi movements from a young age.  At age 14, he joined George Lincoln Rockwell's American Nazi Party.  Following this, he left the American Nazi Party and joined the National Socialist White People's Party.  Due to crimes he committed in his adulthood (including pepper spraying a group of African-American teenagers), Mason was constantly in and out of jail.  Once released, he helped co-found the Atomwaffen Division in 2015.  Once the United States collapsed, he gathered his loyal forces and hosted a meeting in Denver to plan the basis of his new Amerikareich, a state built on racial purity and Spartanism who would prepare for the inevitable race war that would determine the future of the white race."

But one day while a series of riots and protests following an act of police brutality, Miller found himself under attack by members of the political movement known as Antifa, it wasn't until their rival right-wing adversaries the Proud Boys got involved to defend him was Miller's fate sealed. After being doxed and defamed, Paul's descent into hatred began. Gone was Paul Miller the journalist, and here was Gypsy Crusader Militant  White Nationalist.

Aquilino’s storied career included service in Yugoslavia, Iraq, and Afghanistan and command of Carrier Strike Group 2. He later became the thirty-sixth leader of the United States Pacific Fleet, charged with containing China in the Pacific theater.\n\nThe Chaos of the First Months threw his entire command into disarray. With its Californian bases overrun by Chinese-backed Communist revolutionaries, what was left of the Fleet managed to limp back to Alaska and Hawaii. Attempted uprisings in these territories were swiftly put down, and Aquilino was made the reluctant head of a provisional military government with a mandate to liberate the mainland by any necessary means. The Pacific Fleet, once one of the mightiest naval forces on the planet, now faces declining morale, inadequate logistical support, dwindling fuel, and no end to the madness on the home front. But Aquilino and his men will not go quietly into the night."

Their attempts proved futile, and he went on to lead a controversial term. Then 2020 came, and his whole presidency came crashing down.\n\nTrump remained defiant and challenged the election results all through the remainder of the year, and finally culminated by his refusal to transfer power to Biden, the attack on DC by Bidenists, and the following period of anarchy. So he fled to the Midwest and organized his own Government in Denver. A government many call a oligarchy of his closest allies and a government of conspiracies. But Trump is not unintelligent. He now bides his time and waits. Waits for the chance to pacify the rogue warlords in the west and globalists in the east. He waits to reign in the South once again and moved to crush the Penceist traitors in Indiana. He waits to reunite America, and make it great again.\n\nAnd like Julius Caesar and the Rubicon, he will cross the Mississippi and assert his right as president. Whether the people want him or not."

While his first few months as superintendent saw a marked rise in cadet morale due to many of his new policies, this progress came to a halt when the Cadet Regiment was called up to help staunch the growing unrest within the state; when it became clear that the country would only continue to tear itself apart, General Wins and most of VMI's teaching staff were reinstated as officers and charged with leading the nascent Virginian Armed Forces."
