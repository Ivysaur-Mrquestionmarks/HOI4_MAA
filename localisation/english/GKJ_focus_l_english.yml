 gkj.1.t:0 "He is Back"
 gkj.1.d:0 ""NO NO NO NO NO NO!" Barron cried as he tried to hold the doors of his office shut. "MY TIME IS NOT TODAY! I NEED MORE TIME! I NEED MORE TIME! I NE..." \n\n He was cut short by the blast of a breaching charge that sent him sprawling backward. Barron, like a scared dog, scampered behind his desk, still leering from the concussive force of the explosion. \n\nSoon footsteps could be heard entering the office. The smoke slowly fled away as one of the men began to circle the room. Barron, shaking from fear, could feel their footsteps resonate through the blood-soaked floor. \n\n "There you are my child." An ominous voice weaved its way through the smoke. Barron looked up from his fetal position under his desk to see a man leaning over him. "Old Grey Eye is here." \n\n "...How?" Barron whimpered. \n\n The figure walked closer protected by two armed convicts. "It's your fault kid..." \n\n The man slowly knelt near Barron and leaned forward. His face was a mangled mess of scars and burns but yet, a smile still was etched across his face in a sadistic and evil manner. "You should have cut my neck not my eye." \n\n "JEB?!" Barron looked up to see himself face to face with the man he tortured in prison for months. "How did you survive?" \n\n "The will of the Lord kept me alive Barron. It is the same will that allowed me to discover that the main waterlines to your government building were located directly under the prison in which I was held. It is the same will that gave me the ability to smuggle in hallucinogens and lace your water with them. It is the same will that allows me, John Ellis Bush, to lead a revolt against you and stand here now." Now Jeb leaned in even closer and whispered into Barron's blood-soaked ear, \n\n "It is the same will that gives me the throne of Florida and soon the whole country. Goodbye child." \n\n Jeb Bush stood up slowly, his battered body cracking as it moved. "Shall I finish him for you, my lord?" Asked one of the inmates behind Jeb.  \n\n"No" Bush replied. "He is still, just a boy. Even if the Lord states that the sins of the father will become unto the son, we are not yet God's holy judgment" Jeb placed a hand on the inmate’s shoulder. "Take him to Denver to be with his father. You will die by his will and no one can know where you are from."  \n\nJeb touched his forehead to that of the inmate’s. The man was moved to tears, not those of fear or sadness but those of joy. He dropped to his knees as if the world itself was placed upon his back. \n\n"I am beyond honored my Lord and I shall do you bidding as it is by his will" He quickly grabbed Barron and began to drag him out of the office. Jeb held up a hand and the inmate stopped dragging Barron. Slowly, Jeb knelt down and drew close to Barron's ear. \n\n"My boy, this has been the goal from the begining." He whispered. "After all, who do you think had Eric killed?" \n\n Barron flew into a fit of rage but could not manage to hit Jeb as the inmate resumed dragging him down the hall. Jeb smiled. Everything was falling into place. Soon America would come to pay for its sins. "

 gkj.2.t:0 "Floridian Civil War"
 gkj.2.d:0 "In the time since Jeb Bush has stepped down, the state of Florida has devolved into chaos. The army, navy and air force have all but disbanded, the economy has collapsed and massive shortages have began to ravage the populace. With no government above them, the Floridian people have started to flock to whoever can give them food and saftey. \n\n In the South-West Miami governer Francis Suarez has managed to gather a small following and unite many of the big cities in the southern regions. Despite his more moderate stance and Republican background, Suarez has a following of mostly Democrats and other moderates under his reign. \n\n In the West the Seminole nation has arisen to reclaim their lands. A long since conquered nation, the Seminoles where subjected to war, famine and the infamous Trail of Tears. Since tribe leader Marcellus Osceola Jr. declared the nation's begining, many people with Semionole ancestry have flocked back into South-Western Florida to seek a new life. \n\n To the East, on the island of Cape Canaveral, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has clamed much of the land. Not much is known about the nation thus far. They seem to be ruled by a small group of top scientists within NASA and are as secretive than they are wise. Time will only tell what they have in store... \n\n To the West all hell has broken loose. The massive whiplash the military was put through from Barron to Jeb caused a massive amount of desertion. No place felt it worse than St. Petersburg where the lot of its prisioners were freed by a mob. This bizzare mob is made up of other convicts from different jails around the state. Many of them call Tex Watson their leader, though others are just wanting nothing other than pure chaos. The Florida men control the West coast and who knows what their next move will be..."

When he returned he informed the local Miami legislature that a group of convicts had captured the four and forced them to kill each other or die of starvation.

This was not the case today. \n\n"Brother and Sister in Christ! I have returned!" Jeb yelled through into the crowd. "Today marks the begining of a new America. Today marks the day we wake up from the burdens of our sins and transgressions. Today marks the day that we live! I am pleased to say that God has guided me out of prison and before you here to deliver this good news. I still do not know my true purpose as of yet but I am sure that God will deliver it to me in due time. When that time arriv... \n\n Jeb frose dead in his tracks and his one good eye opened wide as if he saw a ghost. "Speak Lord, for I, your good and faithful servant is listening." Jeb said quietly. A few moments passed. The crowd looked on with puzzled looks on their faces, wondering what the hell was going through Jeb's head. Soon enough, Jeb snapped out of it and regained himself. \n\n"I have just been given the plan from God through Gabriel. God has told me his plan, his master plan. You must follow it no matter what my children." \n\nJeb paused a moment before giving a sigh, looking down and then slowly spoke to the crowd. \n\n"God has said that..."

 GKJ_wbb_desc:0 "Westboro Baptist Church has been a standard of unapologetic Christianity for generations. Since its founding in 1954 by the late Fred Phelps, it has stood against the homosexual epidemic here in the United States along with other important issues. Though Fred has died, his youngest son, Timothy, is still living. It would be wise of us to elevate the status of this church in our new nation."

 News_events.101.d:0 "Today in the city of Miami, now known as New Jerusalem, the special forces of the "Ordained State of Florida" known simply as "The American Templars" entered into the city and began to destroy buildings, incarcerate civilians and set most of the city ablaze. This was all set in motion by the nations leader, Jeb Bush. In Jeb's mind, the former city of Miami was not "free of its sin" and was declared unfit to remain standing. He vowed to bring it to its knees, which he seemingly has done. Death reports are still hard to obtain as many reporters and news outlets have been shot or detained upon entering the city. Using UN patrol boats, the offical estimated number from seems to be over ten-thousand."

 gkj.8.d:0 "Jeb Bush paced back and forth in his office, his mind swirling with problems and ideas for the future of the united states. In only a few minutes, he will address his loyal generals and internal advisors reguarding the fate of the nation. Jeb had many options to consider. \n\nShould he allow all people to exist within his nation and take the hard task of converting them to our holy ways? \n\nPerhaps he should only focus on those already christian and help them see to tweak their beliefs. \n\nMaybe even go a step further and only accept the pre reformation christians. Their more staunch view of christianity will surley help them follow us. \n\nJeb stopped in his tracks. He looked out into the streets of New Jerusalem, still suffering from its sin. "Maybe there is no hope for the sinner," He murmered. "Perhaps God wills me to deliver his holy judgement. Perhaps this country is Sodom and Gomorrah," \n\n\n\n"and I am the flame.""
