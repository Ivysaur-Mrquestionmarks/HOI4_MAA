######### Events #########
npa.1.t:0 "[NPA.GetLeader] wants to join us"
npa.1.d:0 "[NPA.GetName] it's a country we've almost forgotten. A front made up of the old republican party members opposing Trump seems to do their best to get our attention. \n\nIn recent private messages, [NPA.GetLeader] has adressed [FRA.GetLeader] to allow him to join our Alliance. In meanwhile, [NPA.GetName] seems to do their best to align their people to our policies."
npa.1.a:0 "We accept allies, especially those fighting with Trump"
npa.1.b:0 "We aren't risking open war for a bunch of softcore republicans"

npa.2.t:0 "[FRA.GetLeader] accepts our pledge"
npa.2.d:0 "We've succesfully pledged allegiance to the Legalists' cause, being now part of the true America. It seems it's going to be a matter of time for [FRA.GetLeader]'s forces to aid our soldiers on field."
npa.2.a:0 "[FRA.GetRulingIdeology] Americans aren't so bad"

npa.3.t:0 "[FRA.GetLeader] does not give a clear response"
npa.3.d:0 "Shortly after being asked to join their alliance, conversations with [FRA.GetLeader] stopped. They ended with vague promises of passive support, and cheering. \n\nWhether people of the [FRA.GetName] just didn't wanted to see us fighting on their side, or wanted to delay the conflict with Trump, they said no. It's just sad."
npa.3.a:0 "What else could we expect from [FRA.GetRulingParty]?"

npa.4.t:0 "Launch of the GRP"
npa.4.d:0 "Great Return Program was initiated. All the propaganda necessary to bring attention in and out of the Indiana was spread in bigger and smaller cities. Posts and campaigns on the Internet were made to sway as much rational people as we can. \n\nOur program seems to attract lot of people, and not all of these are Republicans. In fact - most of them is not Republican at all! Some of these are just people that look for a good cause to fight, extremists and democrats trying to get revenge on Trump, and many other kinds of Americans that want to join us. We need to know who should be welcomed, who not."
npa.4.a:0 "Only the finest and the most loyal people"
npa.4.b:0 "All the eager republicans and conservatives will do"
npa.4.c:0 "Democrats can join our boat. As long as they're loyal"
npa.4.e:0 "Allow everyone, even commies! They are cannon fodder anyways"

npa.5.t:0 "Results of The Patriotic Propaganda"
npa.5.d:0 "After passionate speeches, tirades and battles on social media, we managed to straighten up promises we've given, replacing them with the idea of ''patient war with evil''. Some of our citizens liked it, some not, but the most important is - those who were believing our words are now assured our battle is the patriotic duty of every American."
npa.5.a:0 "Affirmation has an unbelievable power"
npa.5.b:0 "...Although our people don't care anymore, eh."

npa.6.t:0 "We've ''accidentally'' declared war on Minnesota factions"
npa.6.d:0 "Some of our reserve armies, to the surprise of the soldiers, were sent north to attack the collapsed state of Minnesota. The order went from the High Command, and there's a serious suspicion that we had defector in our HQ. \n\nIt might be even [NPA.GetName] that is trying to open the second front to make us busy. Whoever it was, we can't just undo the attack."
npa.6.a:0 "We'll deal with Minnesota. Find out who gave the order, and why"

npa.7.t:0 "White Peace"
npa.7.d:0 "With Trump defeated, we have accomplished our main objective. However, there are still holdouts in Maine and the Rocky Mountains that we are unable to reach. For now, a white peace will have to do."
npa.7.a:0 "Not exactly ideal..."

npa.8.t:0 "The Future of Indiana's Media"
npa.8.d:0 "Since the fall of America, our citizens have been forced to listen to content produced by total loonies such as Alex Jones, watch internet battles spammed by the guys from radical left and right. Media became so hostile that our citizens stopped watching them at all, as there wasn't any good alternative.\n\nWe are the only ones that can do something about medial revolution - by countering it wiht our own high quality content. What would it be, though?"
npa.8.a:0 "Our very own and reliable news channel"
npa.8.b:0 "Own Christian television, to give us hope and faith"
npa.8.c:0 "Revive Garfield series, the pearl of Indiana!"

npa.9.t:0 "Garfield series revived!"
npa.9.d:0 "Nobody would have expected the NPA, fighting for its life to revive the Garfield series. The revival met with great American approval, as well as international reviews, describing the new series as a "masterpiece" forged in the face of the terrible conflict in which the United States is plunged. In Trump's America, the episodes were censored, but most other states chose to air them, making virtually all of America now condemning Trump's warfare. \n\n New episodes show Garfield as a "lazy patriot", tirelessly resisting absurd war acts of the narcissistic villain Drumpf von Golden Dump. The creators announce a continuation as long as the issue is possible, and as long as only ''real Drumpf'' troops won't enter Indiana."
npa.9.a:0 "Garfield was a real patriot all the time"

npa.10.t:0 "Incredible success of Garfield series"
npa.10.d:0 "Our results have exceeded expectations... The new Garfield series has become the main cartoon watched in the American States plunged in war. International companies enter into contracts with us, offering us help to ensure that the last center of American culture survives. Even some Californian producers moved to Indianapolis elite district called now "New Hollywood".  \n\n If we manage to win the war, with new contracts, millionaires and companies, Indianapolis could become the capital of the new American cinematography."

npa.15.t:0 "GOP Debate Result"
npa.15.d:0 "Today, at the official meeting of [FRA.GetLeader] and [NPA.GetLeader] the great debate hosted in Indiana has been taking place. Except for democrat media portraying a conflict aimed at a destruction of the [NPA.GetName], fiery speech have been made by [FRA.GetLeader] to condemn all the actions taken by the Trump's defectors. \n\n''May the whole America know that Trump's so-called GOP is illegal. They are not Republicans. You can find real American patriots, real Republicans in the [NPA.GetName]. It's the only legal Republican party, and the true predecessor of the GOP.'' - said [FRA.GetLeader] at the end of the debate. \n\nThough the most ardent supporters of Trump were not impressed by the speech, it gave great feeling of superiority to the people of [NPA.GetName]. Our party seems to be stronger than ever, with the people that know what they want, continuing the right legacy."
npa.15.a:0 "Who's the traitor now, Mr. Trump?"

npa.17.t:0 "The Legitimists Demand Our Submission!"
npa.17.d:0 ""
npa.17.a:0 "Yes"
npa.17.b:0 "No"

npa.18.t:0 "We Are Going To Be Partitioned!"
npa.18.d:0 "We ignored all the signs. [NPA.GetLeader] and [FRA.GetLeader] got along and formed alliance, sending us the ultimatum to give up and allow the entry of their soldiers to annex us. \n\nThere's not much we can do anymore. Without good allies we got no chances with those two collosuses. What shall we do?"
npa.18.a:0 "That's it. That's our end. At least it'll be peaceful..."
npa.18.b:0 "They'll never take our freedom!"

npa.19.t:0 "[AFS.GetLeader] Surrenders"
npa.19.d:0 "[AFS.GetLeader] has sent an official conditional surrender message. He only requested that his right to freedom should be respected and he should not be prosecuted by any authorities of ours. \n\n[AFS.GetName] lands now rightfully belong to us."
npa.19.a:0 "Victory without a bloodshed!"

npa.20.t:0 "[AFS.GetLeader] Resists!"
npa.20.d:0 "[AFS.GetLeader] has sent an official message saying ''Nuts!''. Whatever the news meant, the AFS troops mobilized. \n\nWe'll need to drop this fool from his throne with a violent force."
npa.20.a:0 "We will teach this idiot a lesson!"

npa.21.t:0 "The Proposal of Unification?"
npa.21.d:0 "With the collapse of the federal government and the civil war, many of us assumed the United States or a similar government would not form for decades. However seeing that [NPA.GetName] eliminated the loyalist cause, [NPA.GetLeder] reached out to us about the idea of reunifying our nation. \n\nWe would return to our old system of government with free and fair elections, we would work together with the [FRA.GetName] administration and most importantly, we would have all Americans rally around our star spangled banner. It does not matter our beliefs, Republican, Democrat or whatever - all that matters is that we in the [NPA.GetName] and the [FRA.GetName] are Americans, and will do everything in our power to reunify this great country. \n\nShall we go through with this great endeavor?"
npa.21.a:0 "Let’s make the founding fathers proud!"
npa.21.b:0 "We simply are not ready for such a proposition"

npa.22.t:0 "The Return of the United States of America!"
npa.22.d:0 "Following the agreement of reunification, the capital building in Indiana has become the temporary capital and the President of the [FRA.GetName] has become the Vice President. When all 50 states are brought back into the fold, we shall have New Democratic elections that will be open and fair. \n\nAcross the country you could hear fireworks, laughing, parades and music as citizens rejoiced for reunification. It does not matter who they voted for, who the fought for or where they are from, today everyone is a patriot and today everyone is an American. People would now look at the American flag and think not of the brutal war that divided them? But they see it as for what it once was, a symbol of democracy and hope. \n\nHope is not something that was common with the collapse, but as the new government was sworn in and the US constitution was reformed, hope was the one word to describe the atmosphere of the country."
npa.22.a:0 "God Bless the United States of America!"

npa.23.t:0 "Unification Has Failed"
npa.23.d:0 "It seems [FRA.GetRulingParty] was never interested in rebuilding America. [FRA.GetName] rejected the offer of the unification without giving any reason. \n\nDid they not want old America back?"
npa.23.a:0 "Does it mean we are on our own now?"

npa.24.t:0 "The Rebirth of America!"
npa.24.d:0 "Following successful talks between the [FRA.GetName] and the [NPA.GetName], an agreement to reform the United States has come into effect. For the first time since the civil war, a legitimate government made up of both Republicans and Democrats alike has been created. Promising the restoration of free and fair elections, as well as a plan to reunify the rest of the core territory of the United States, the legitimized government has merged with the [NPA.GetName]. \n\nToday is a great day for Americans, as well  as the rest of the free world."
npa.24.a:0 "For the land of the free and the home of the brave!"

npa.25.t:0 "Unification talks fail"
npa.25.d:0 "With the [NPA.GetName] toppling the Trump Regime, there were several movements to unify with the [FRA.GetName] to reform the government of the United States of America. But for various reasons both partisan and non-partisan, talks of peaceful unification have failed. \n\nMany are saying that this is a sign that if the country were to ever reunify under any government it would not be by peace talks, but it would be reunified through blood."
npa.25.a:0 "A house divided against itself cannot stand"

npa.26.t:0 "Dissidents Arrested and Exiled"
npa.26.d:0 "We started the action ''In God We Trust''. As we expected, there weren't many citizens that are against us, and had not left our territories. \n\nSome politicians from the old GOP party were locked up, but doesn't pose any threat anymore. As a result of our action, the final bastion of the opposition, Valparaiso University was nationalised, just like the rest of the troublemaking institutes."
npa.26.a:0 "A Small Price for a Brighter Future"

npa.27.t:0 "Dissidents Arrested and Shot"
npa.27.d:0 "We started the action ''In God We Trust''. There were many citizens disagreeing with our new order of politics, but those were convinced with a force that what we do is right. \n\nMost of the old GOP party politicians were locked up, some of them shot to give an example. As a result of our action, the final bastion of the opposition, Valparaiso University was closed, all free-thinking idiots taken in custody. Some of the colleges and institutes refused to elaborate, moving out of our nation."
npa.27.a:0 "Damn Academics"

npa.28.t:0 "Hours of Chaos"
npa.28.d:0 "We started the action ''In God We Trust''. It ignited some uprisings we've succesfully taken down. The public opinion, criticising our actions had to be taken down too, just like the rest of the opposition. \n\nRemnants of the old GOP party politicians fled to neighbouring states, some of them were shot trying. As a result of our action, the final bastion of the opposition, Valparaiso University was raided, and bombed to the ground. All the other independent colleges and institutes were raided, because as expected, these were the main sources of social dissent."
npa.28.a:0 "It could be way worse..."

npa.29.t:0 "Valparaiso Uprising!"
npa.29.d:0 "The thought of destroying the opposition was a mistake. A tragic mistake. Our police and army was outnumbered, and eventually defected. Former GOP politicians joined the new movement, called the Revolution Against Tyrrany. \n\nThe civil war has broke out, by some named the continuation of the American war against wannabe-Trumpite tyrrany. Head of the Valparaiso University - university known of its fondness to Marxism, became the leader of the Red Rebellion - union of people that want to put an end to the fascist tyrrany in US of A."
npa.29.a:0 "Look at the clock. It's time to remove commies"
npa.29.b:0 "The Heart of the America is Red, just like the GOP. CHARGE!"

npa.30.t:0 "A Rather Merry Retirement"
npa.30.d:0 "From the outset, Pence was against the party's radicalization. He described our new government as "the next instalment of the Trump's dictatorship" and us, as the disgrace of the US of A. The words were quite strong for an old man who had recently retired. Some people openly miss the old Pence we are now trying to silence using all the necessary measures.\n\nIt is clear that Pence won't cope with us. However, we have a way to change it, using the argument of violence. If we decide to make him a figurehead, Pence will be put in his house arrest, and his family will be taken as hostages - we'll be able to control him - and so the crowds will be satisfied. We may also symbolically kill him, as he's the last symbol of the Old Nation, and the only obstacle that stands in our way to the ultimate power."
npa.30.a:0 "Lock him up. Make him a nice, obedient figurehead..."
npa.30.b:0 "Tie a noose around his neck - it is the time"

npa.31.t:0 "Long Live Pence"
npa.31.d:0 "The talks in our parliament were concluded. Our country, built on the ruins of the old America - will receive a constitution that will respect the life-lasting presidency. Almost every single citizen of ours agrees that Pence should be America's ''New Caesar''. Pence himself is a little confused with the idea, but seeing the overwhelming support for it, agrees to become the absolutist GOP party and people want him to be.\n\nThe question remains whether it should be a strong, autocratic presidency or a literal "coronation" of the Pence as Emperor. Although more serious and older people prefer his dictatorial presidency, the youth would like to see Mike Pence as the actual crowned Emperor with the new name - Pencus Maximus."
