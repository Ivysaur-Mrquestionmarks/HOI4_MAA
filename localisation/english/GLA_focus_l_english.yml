 GLA_lgbtq_rights:0 "Promote LGBTQ+ Culture"
 GLA_lgbtq_rights_desc:0 "It’s no longer the 1800s. Being Gay has become acceptable in much of the developed world, so it would be hypocritical of us to dictate who a person can and cannot like. We will spread the LGBTQ culture of openness and inclusivity to give a community to all those people who might feel unwanted or hated. There are still many who are wary of the LGBTQ community, so we will also fund programs to spread awareness."
 GLA_establish_a_libertarian_youth_wing:0 "Establish A Libertarian Youth Wing"

If there were someone else smart enough to guide this nation down the right path, I’d let them, absolutely; the reality, however, is that there is no such person.
