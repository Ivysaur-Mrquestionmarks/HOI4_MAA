 Unpopolar_Libertarian_Administration_desc:0 "Libertarianism is not a very popular ideology among the Great Lakes currently. Ever since Jorgensen’s rise to power and her eventual declaration of president in the GLA, she has not been a popular figure. The only thing supporting our country is a loyal Boogaloo militia and law enforcement force. Without them, our country would’ve fragmented into Anarchy. We must ensure this does not happen."

 greatlake.1.d:0 "Taking advantage of the temporary peace, the Battle Hardened Boogaloo Militia stationed within the capitol stormed the presidential building, demanding that Jorgensen hold elections to determine whether or not the people truly supported the government. A woman of the people, Jorgensen accepted. The Jorgensen government has been strife with controversy, after attempting to enact conscription to save themselves from the unrelenting Trumpist front. The Great Lakes were saved by the Good Friday Peace Accord but lost Western Wisconsin, Chicago, and Detroit to Petty Tyrants. \n\n"

 greatlake.18.d:0 "Hundreds of people gathered in Lansing as a big announcement had been posted all over social media and news involving Ron Paul. The cold, crisp, air made many people tingle in excitement with hopes that the wait was worth it. When people saw men dressed in black uniforms and armed with handguns and rifles, they were ecstatic, realizing this was some form of the Secret Service. The crowd erupted when Ron Paul walked out onto the stage, and began his speech. \n\n “Ladies and Gentlemen” \n\n He said, the crowd running quiet \n\n “I’m running for president!”"

 greatlake.19.d:0 "The streets of Grand Rapid are congested with people, as old and young, short, and tall, and every person in the city gathers for a major event. An announcement by John McAfee. Being just a few days after the announcement of Ron Paul’s campaign, the streets were rightfully crowded, with theories that John McAfee would run too. John walks onto the stage, grabs hold of a microphone, and quiets the audience. \n\n “Ladies and gentlemen, I bring you all here tonight to announce a very special event. I am running for president of the Great Lakes!”"

Many people tuned into the news, as a very special political announcement was to take place. Many people assumed this was the recent Boogaloo militia news, but many were surprised to see Gary Johnson on the screen \n\n “Why hello there friends! You may be surprised to see me!

 greatlake.22.d:0 "“Welcome ladies and gentlemen to a very special political event, the presidential debate! I’m your host Melissa Watson, here to bring to you the debate!” \n\n The room falls quiet, as debaters begin shuffling through flash cards, whispers from the audience begin, a quiet hum can be heard from the massive board behind them, showing on one side the political party each represents. Finally, a news reporter sticks her microphone above the audience. \n\n “Ms. Jorgensen, what can you bring to this nation economically” she says, with many reporters groaning from the missed opportunity. \n\n “If elected, I promise economic prosperity for our people, and an economy that no other nation involved in this war has” \n\n “Wow, a bold statement coming from our very own Mama Jo! What about you, Gary” \n\n “If I take power, I promise economic prosperity for our people as well. Except, I can prove it. My plans are simple. I will follow a strict small-government approach, just like what i did in New Mexico. And i will enact income tax cuts. It’s a simple process” \n\n Heavy cheering and clapping is heard from the audience, as Jorgensen is sweating and stammering over her words. \n\n “I promise a reclamation of America!” she shouts happily to the audience \n\n The crowds at home and in public explode clapping. Nobody expected this as most Libertarians wanted neutrality and economic flourish instead of conquest. \n\n The crowd then falls silent as Gary speaks once again. \n\n “How could you focus on expansion rather than economic values? It seems like you can’t even protect your own party from opposition.” he says with a slick smile while pointing at himself and his side of the board, showing his political party. \n\n The crowd begins laughing and giggling quietly, but in a way where it can be heard easily. \n\n Ron Paul, forgotten by the crowd, quietly remarks how he intends to also bring the nation to the rest of America, clearly stuttering over his words, while reading from a script on his table” \n\n “Calm it old geezer, wouldn’t wanna bust a nerve!” Gary shouts \n\n The crowd goes wild, laughing at Ron and Jorgensen as Gary grills them both on the stands. \n\n Ron, growing with anger, goes off script \n\n “Hey pal I’ve been writing books since you were soiling your diaper! I know more about America than you know about your own mother” \n\n The audience laughs once again at Gary this time, as Gary is finally facing resistance. \n\n When the crowd finally quits again, Jorgensen, visibly fearing Gary’s charisma to the audience, begins a series of remarks of how the Libertarians were formed, how the United States collapsed, and how she believes that they will reclaim all of America. The crowd, although hooked, does not believe her words, and show little signs of patriotism and support, but more of boredom. \n\n Gary seized this opportunity. \n\n “Ma’am, calm down. You gotta win the election first!” he states, slyly smiling once again at the crowd. \n\n The crowd now erupts in laughter. Fearing an embarrassment for Jorgensen, the secret service orders to shut down the debate. \n\n Jorgensen, now in her car on the way back to Milwaukee, is enraged. \n\n “How could this have happened! They were supposed to support me! I’m screwed! I’ll never win this election” \n\n The taxi driver, hearing this, and realizing that Jorgensen is almost yelling at him, states, \n\n “Maybe you aren’t destined to be president”"

Their influence has finally fallen short however, as with the strike of a gavel their anti-government militia and pro-gun ideals and anarchist extremes can be swept under the carpet."

 greatlake.31.t:0 "Mercenaries..."
 greatlake.31.d:0 "With the seizing of power by John McAfee and his Ancaps, we can finally begin establishing a real military. A military of mercenaries. With money, who needs a national guard or an army when you can just pay people to do that stuff for you. We have way too much of this money and the Boogaloo have been causing chaos in the Great Lakes, so maybe these mercenaries can fix a couple of our problems."

 greatlake.32.t:0 "Keeping The Boogaloo Militias..."
 greatlake.32.d:0 "Due to the collapsing state of the GLA politically and economically, we might need someone to protect us. These people are the Boogaloo militias. The Boogaloo, as chaotic and unorganized as they are, are a very helpful part in keeping us alive. We don't pay them, they willingly exist, and they cost us only a little bit of resources and guns.
