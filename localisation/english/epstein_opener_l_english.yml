 mod_overview_header_MAA: "§YMod Overview:§!"
 mod_overview_MAA: "Following Trump's refusal to concede, Joe Biden established a rival government which very quickly descended on the White House. Narrowly escaping with his life, Trump vowed to retake his rightful place as President and fled to the Loyalist states. During the so-called 'Chaos of the First Months', many other groups also seized their best chance at victory and rose up. Now, a ceasefire has been signed for Easter on Good Friday. Will the peace hold? Nobody but the insane believes so.\n\nWill you unite America, or will you ensure it remains divided forever?"

 mod_good_friday_header_MAA: "§CGood Friday Ceasefire§!"
 mod_lore_good_friday_MAA: "Civil War has broken out in the United States! After both Donald Trump and Joe Biden claimed victory in the 2020 Presidential Election, rival governments were formed which inevitably broke out into Civil War in January 2021. Seizing their best chance to reach power, various other groups also rose up throughout the nation.\nFollowing the Chaos of the First Three Months, a temporary ceasefire has finally been signed on Good Friday. But everyone knows it is not to last."
 mod_lot_header_MAA: "§CThe Land of Traitors§!"
 mod_lore_lot_MAA: "In the land where cotton was once king, a great trial awaits the people of the South. When Kanye West and his broad coalition of dissidents seized control over the majority of the land of the Old Confederacy, it changed the area forever. Now, however, President West and his allies must fight to keep their fledgling state in tact, while their neighbours scheme and plot their own machinations.\nIn the distance, we hear the thunders muttering. Will they bring chaos or opportunity?"
 mod_wcw_header_MAA: "§CWest Coast Wars§!"
 mod_lore_wcw_MAA: "Pandamonium in the West! As it became increasingly clear this most uncivil of wars was not going to be a quick affair, the people of the West Coast became increasingly concerned. As D.C.'s influence fell, and Beijing's grew, it became but a matter of time until the Pacific broke off from the Federal Government and declared their own provisional 'People's Republic'. In the process, they alienated a large portion of their support, resulting in the Cascadian Revolution and the Pacific Mutiny. What will become of the West?"

 #FRA
 FRA_opener_country_overview: "Ever since Obama passed the Office of President to Trump, America has been disgraced. Biden, although he had his faults, was undoubtedly better than Trump and when he ultimately won the election, Trump refused to concede. \nThe Bidenist forces, after being pushed out of California and relegated to the East Coast, are strong, but not strong enough to fight all of America... Only when the Bidenist forces move to restore the legitimate government, only then will America TRULY be saved."

 # Tech Overview #
 mod_tech_header_MAA: "§YTechnology Rework and Changes:§!"
 mod_tech_at_and_aa_MAA: "§CAnti-Tank and Anti-Air Infantry Variants:§!\nNew technologies for cheaper yet less effective infantry AT and AA are now implemented. They give infantry the ability to fight off aircraft and armor units, they are used in support companies or added to normal units through doctrines."
 mod_tech_navy_rework_MAA: "§CNavy Rework:§!\nBattleships aren't typically used in the modern battlefield anymore, and even if you may find instances of them, you won't be able to produce them as a part of your navy rework. In their place, to fulfill the navy's least impactful role, in the mod you will find new cheaper ships such as LCSes (very cheap ships meant to defend your coastline), and amphibious assault ships which have limited carrier like capabilities, while costing a fraction of what a carrier would normally cost."
 mod_tech_missiles_MAA: "§CMissiles:§!\nTogether with the navy rework we added new missiles and missile types. They can be launched from either missile silos or from the new missile pod module for ships (if you have Man the Guns enabled). The new missiles include: anti-ship missiles, more SAM variants, and cruise missiles."
 mod_tech_air_and_drones_MAA: "§CAir and Drones:§!\nAir has been reworked so that the non-BBA planes are default for everyone (YOU CAN DISABLE THIS IN GAME RULES). This has been done so that aircraft designs are more realistic. New technologies in the form of multiroles and helicopters (assault and supply) have been added. Drones have also been added, which can either perform CAS operations or serve as a support company. Drones are very good and I (TurkishPikachu) highly reccomend using them."
 mod_tech_ifv_and_tanks_MAA: "§CIFV and Tanks:§!\nIn MAA, Medium Tanks have been replaced by IFVs, which combined with Main Battle Tanks (Heavy Tanks) are very powerful. Light Tanks are now best and only practical for recon, as you wil mainly want to focus on heavy tanks. Many custom modules have also been added for tanks."

 mod_mechanics_header_MAA: "§YNew and Reworked Mechanics:§!"
 mod_mechanics_black_market_MAA: "§CBlack Market Overview:§!\nAs you may have seen, MAA is only in North America. Resources can be limited, and to solve this we have created a Black Market GUI in the decisions tab, exchanging daily political power gain and factories for any resource."
 mod_mechanics_international_market_MAA: "§CInternational Market Removal:§!\nAs you may have noticed, the International Market/Diplomacy Button on the top bar has been removed. There are many reasons for this, including bug fixing and the fact that it just did not make sense in the context of this mod, and changing it is nearly impossible as most of it is hard-coded in the base game."
 mod_mechanics_path_guides_MAA: "§CCustom Path Guides for Certain Nations:§!\nLike many other big mods, we have integrated our path guides into the game! To access the path guides, go to the Political View of your country and click the "question mark" near the top right. Although not all nations have path guides integrated at the moment, currently, the [FRA.GetName], [GRL.GetName], [GLA.GetName], and [TEX.GetName] have path guides."
 mod_mechanics_mercenaries_MAA: "§CMercenaries:§!\nIf you ever find yourself a little short on troops and/or equipment, you can rent mercenaries for a certain amount of political power and factories in your decisions! The more expensive the mercenaries are, the better they tend to be."
 MAA_PATHS_TUTORIAL: "Path Guide Visual"
 mod_mechanics_fuel_system_MAA: "§CFuel Mechanic Overview:§!\nLocated in the construction tab, there is a red button that opens the GUI to our fuel mechanic. Using this GUI, you can exchange construction speed and/or factory output for higher fuel gain, or vise-versa. Fuel can also be gained by constructing nuclear reactors."
