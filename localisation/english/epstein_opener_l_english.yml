 mod_overview_MAA: "Following Trump's refusal to concede, Joe Biden established a rival government which very quickly descended on the White House. Narrowly escaping with his life, Trump vowed to retake his rightful place as President and fled to the Loyalist states. During the so-called 'Chaos of the First Months', many other groups also seized their best chance at victory and rose up. Now, a ceasefire has been signed for Easter on Good Friday. Will the peace hold? Nobody but the insane believes so.\n\nWill you unite America, or will you ensure it remains divided forever?"

 FRA_opener_country_overview: "Ever since Obama passed the Office of President to Trump, America has been disgraced. Biden, although he had his faults, was undoubtedly better than Trump and when he ultimately won the election, Trump refused to concede. \nThe Bidenist forces, after being pushed out of California and relegated to the East Coast, are strong, but not strong enough to fight all of America... Only when the Bidenist forces move to restore the legitimate government, only then will America TRULY be saved."
