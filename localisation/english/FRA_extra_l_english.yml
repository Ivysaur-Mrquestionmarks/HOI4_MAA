 # EVENTS
 bidone.1.t:0 "A Meeting with McConnell"
 bidone.1.d:0 "Early this morning, senate minority leader and defacto leader of the GOP in the Federal Republic of America, Mitch McConnell was invited by President Joe Biden to discuss the future of this great nation. Although the 2 haven’t seen eye-to-eye for most of their lives, it appears that the 2 have formed a unique bond following Trump’s disastrous presidency. \nIt is time for compromise and coming together, not radicalism and polarization."
 bidone.1.a:0 "Together we will crush the orange plum"
 
 bidone.2.t:0 "The First Amendment"
 bidone.2.d:0 "The First Amendment of our constitution grants us one of our greatest liberties: the freedom of speech. However, recently culture war malarkey and the monopoly of social media by a handful of company have put this freedom in jeopardy. It is time we act to protect this liberty we hold so dear to our hearts."
 bidone.2.a:0 "Our Greatest Amendment"
 
 bidone.3.t:0 "The Art of Compromise"
 bidone.3.d:0 "The essence of democracy is founded upon one simple principle: compromise. Yet, in recent years, we’ve seen a steady erosion of this cornerstone, replaced by inflexible ideologies and a deepening chasm between opposing factions. The world today seems ever more fractured, and our political landscape has become a battleground for competing interests, leaving little room for dialogue. It is time to rediscover the delicate balance that once allowed us to move forward as a united people. \n\nThis morning, a remarkable moment unfolded: President Joe Biden extended an olive branch to the leader of the GOP, Mitch McConnell. Despite years of fierce rivalry and discord, they have agreed to meet face-to-face. Both have seen the toll of divisiveness—one that only served to strengthen extremism on all sides. It is clear that the time for harsh rhetoric is over. \n\nAs the two leaders sit down in the heart of the nation’s capital, the eyes of the world are upon them. Will this be the dawn of a new era of cooperation, or will old wounds prove too deep to heal? The challenge is clear: to reignite the spirit of compromise and pull our fractured nation from the brink of self-destruction. The path ahead is uncertain, but one thing is certain: radicalism has failed us. It is time to rebuild, together."
 bidone.3.a:0 "Can't we all just get along?"
 
 bidone.4.t:0 "We Are America!"
 bidone.4.d:0 "We are America! We are the greatest nation to have ever existed! We had the largest economy in the world, the strongest economy in the world. \nWe have the most productive workers in the world! Given a fair shot, given a fair chance, Americans have never, ever, ever, ever let their country down. \nNever. Never!"
 bidone.4.a:0 "Second to none!"
 
 bidone.5.t:0 "We Are America!"
 bidone.5.d:0 "We are America! We are the greatest nation to have ever existed! We had the largest economy in the world, the strongest economy in the world. \nWe have the most productive workers in the world! Given a fair shot, given a fair chance, Americans have never, ever, ever, ever let their country down. \nNever. Never!"
 bidone.5.a:0 "Second to none! And we own the finish line!"
 
 bidone.6.t:0 "A Return to Rational Economics"
 bidone.6.d:0 "Under the previous administration, economic policy was… questionable at best. Tax cuts for the rich while raising them on those with a lower income? Malarkey! \n\nWe must rebuild our economy to make sure that we are a place our youth want to stay in, to grow in, and to fight for! \nWe must re-create the economic system where rationality takes precedence."
 bidone.6.a:0 "And it shall be called 'Bidenomics'"
 
 bidone.7.t:0 "Expanding the Affordable Care Act"
 bidone.7.d:0 "One of the greatest accomplishments of the American government in the 21st century was the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obama Care. Joe Biden will continue Obama’s legacy by expanding on this initiative, giving millions of Americans greater healthcare coverage and cheaper insurance. Healthcare is a right for all, not a privilege."
 bidone.7.a:0 "And you get insurance! And YOU get insurance! Everyone gets insurance!"
 
 bidone.8.t:0 "The Climate Problem"
 bidone.8.d:0 "For the past 2 centuries we have been killing our planet with the burning of toxic gasses releasing carbon dioxide into our atmosphere. This problem is too big to shove away, too big to ignore. We must stop killing our planet. \n\nToday President Joe Biden will sign into law the first of many initiatives aiming at combating climate change, including the decreasing of dependance on fossil fuels and the planting of new trees."
 bidone.8.a:0 "Let it grow, let it grow!"
 
 bidone.9.t:0 "'Malarkey' Files: Guns"
 bidone.9.d:0 "Guns are Malarkey! \n\nIt is undeniable that the former United States has had a problem with guns. We have had more school shootings than every other country combined! Something must be done about this problem. \nThere have also been many members of our military severely injured or killed in rural Pennsylvania attempting to crush rebellions. We may be able to use this as an "excuse" to rid our country of assault rifles - at the bare minimum."
 bidone.9.a:0 "Further Restrictions"
 
 bidone.10.t:0 "'Malarkey' Files: MAGA Movement"
 bidone.10.d:0 "MAGA is Malarkey! \n\nThis extremist, populist ideology has damaged our country nearly beyond repair! It is the very reason why the United States are no longer united! Even the international community recognizes this movement as dangerously extreme. We must deal with them, while they are weak."
 bidone.10.a:0 "America is greater now!"
 
 bidone.11.t:0 "The Malarkey Problem"
 bidone.11.d:0 "Malarkey is everywhere! \n\nPresident Donald Trump left this country in a state of ruin and extreme damage, and it is now up to us to fix it. We need to clean up the Malarkey and dispose of it, making America great again for all our people, we will rise again! \n\nWait...\n\nWAIT A SECO-"
 bidone.11.a:0 "We must finish it off!"
 
 bidone.12.t:0 "Passing the Torch"
 bidone.12.d:0 "Sad news from the White House as now Ex-President Joseph Biden has had to pass the torch and resign from the role of President of the Ex-US, now the Legitimists, giving the role to who was his Vice President, Kamala Harris. The Federal Government bids farewell to the Old Man, who can now rest well in his retirement!"
 bidone.12.a:0 "One last goodbye, Sleepy Joe"
 
 bidone.13.t:0 "A Gracious Exit"
 bidone.13.d:0 "Biden announces his retirement from the federal office. At a time like this during the turmoil of the American Civil war, Biden chooses to retire, and live in a more peaceful place then where he’d be in the White House. Now Biden, at the height of notoriety, and arguably popularity, can sleep like a king for his final years."
 bidone.13.a:0 "He just- retires?"
 
 bidone.14.t:0 "The Silent Coup"
 bidone.14.d:0 "Kamala, that wise snake, knew something was up with Biden. She knew his health was deteriorating rapidly and knew if she didn’t do something quickly, she’d be locked in as an average VP, instead of getting her so-called deserved presidency. Invoking the 25th Amendment, she was able to peacefully remove Biden from power. Although this is a scandalous move, it is within her rights to do this. For better or for worse."
 bidone.14.a:0 "Sweet 25th"
 
 bidone.15.t:0 "The 2024 Democratic Primary"
 bidone.15.d:0 "The Democratic Party is back! With the portrait of Biden being thrown into the fire, the future of the Donkeys in Blue shall be decided by either Michelle Obama, who is supported by the more progressive wing of the party, or Kamala Harris, the current president. In the end, the winner is..."
 bidone.15.a:0 "Kamala Harris!"
 bidone.15.b:0 "Michelle Obama!"
 
 bidone.16.t:0 "Progressive Anger"
 bidone.16.d:0 "The people are mad. Very mad. Kamala Harris turned out to be just as bad as those pro MAGA-rats to her more progressive peoples! Supporting them too much, she can’t be trusted they say. Many parties are already had, and it seems to the people that supporting another one, especially like the Republican Party, would throw the delicate balance into disarray!"
 bidone.16.a:0 "And the Snake Mistress loses her tail!"
 
 bidone.17.t:0 "The 2024 Progressive Party Primary"
 bidone.17.d:0 "Although only one person makes it through to the end of the Primary, this re-establishment is a great precedent to a new country, with new varying ideas being shared more with the Progressives returning. With this, will the Bull Moose return?"
 bidone.17.a:0 "Founder and leader Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez will be the next president!"
 
 bidone.18.t:0 "The 2024 Republican Party Primary"
 bidone.18.d:0 "A drought, crickets, one man remains in the desert that is the Republican Party, his reforms can bring the world together or split them apart. Only those in blue can see the future."
 bidone.18.a:0 "Is there anyone else left except Mitch McConnell?"
 
 bidone.19.t:0 "The 2024 Presidential Elections!"
 bidone.19.d:0 "It’s back! The Biggest Bout on the Global Stage is back! A fierce fight between John Doe and Jane Smith! Two people… nobody has heard of… That doesn’t matter though, elections are back, marking a great day in the history of the United States, and it being clear that even collapsed, a house can stand.\n\nAnd the crowd..\nWait...\nThere’s no crowd..."
 bidone.19.a:0 "Harris-Pelosi ticket wins!"
 bidone.19.b:0 "Through the leftist divide, the McConnell-Kennedy ticket pulls through!"
 bidone.19.c:0 "The Obama-Pelosi ticket wins in a landslide!"
 bidone.19.e:0 "The upstart Cortez-Warren ticket finishes with an electoral upset!"
 bidone.19.f:0 "A deadlock!"
 
 bidone.20.t:0 "Michelle Obama Wins the 2024 Elections!"
 bidone.20.d:0 "News from the Federal Republic of America today shows a win for the Democrats in the 2024 elections! Michelle Obama having carried the most states wins and will be America's second female president."
 bidone.20.a:0 "Is it first gentlemen or Mr. President?"
 
 bidone.21.t:0 "Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez Wins the 2024 Elections!"
 bidone.21.d:0 "Although initial results showed that the Harris-Pelosi ticket was set to win the election, the upstart Progressive Party led by Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez combined with a genius campaign by the McConnell-Kennedy ticket created a 3 way split. However, from all the confusion and anger Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez pulled ahead in a very narrow plurality in the key state of New York, which polls suggested would be evenly divided."
 bidone.21.a:0 "The rich won't be happy..."
 
 bidone.22.t:0 "Deadlock in the 2024 Elections!"
 bidone.22.d:0 "Although initial results showed that the Harris-Pelosi ticket was set to win the election, the upstart Progressive Party led by Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez combined with a genius campaign by the McConnell-Kennedy ticket created a 3-way impasse. The results will now be decided by each state in the House of Representatives, however with the 3 parties nearly controlling an even amount of states, the result of the vote (or votes) will be watched closely."
 bidone.22.a:0 "What happens next?"
 
 bidone.23.t:0 "Rioters Take to the Streets"
 bidone.23.d:0 "Another deadlock, in a new yet old country. How can this be possible? The people don’t know, and they are enraged by it. Moving from their homes to the streets below, corps after corps after corps of rioters parade around the cities of the Legitimasts, as their government has gone defunct, a precedent set by the last government gone defunct."
 bidone.23.a:0 "Washington’s in flames yet again."
 
 bidone.24.t:0 "The 98th Attempt of Choosing the President"
 bidone.24.d:0 "A dying dogs last attempts to lick its wounds and survive another day. The currently Legitimist government has decided to try to make a compromise, another vote per say, to break the deadlock and revive the government. Although it is a lofty effort, it still can succeed."
 bidone.24.a:0 "Kamala Harris, the compromise pulls through!"
 bidone.24.b:0 "The vote fails!"

But that progress was rolled back. Today, I’m here to say: No more.\n\nEvery child in America deserves access to fresh, nutritious meals—because how can we expect them to learn, to grow, to lead, if we don’t give them the fuel they need? We are bringing back the Better School Lunches program, investing in our schools, and ensuring that no child has to trade their health for a cheap, processed meal.\n\nThis isn’t just about food—it’s about our future.

Because the truth is, change is coming—whether they like it or not. Equal pay, reproductive rights, family leave, affordable healthcare—this administration is here to deliver.

He was one of many, standing shoulder to shoulder in a crowded union hall, desperate for change. With every grievance, every story of hardship, AOC felt the weight of her presidency press down on her shoulders.\nA particularly exhausted woman, no older than 35, stepped forward. Her hands were trembling, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\n"Madam President, my husband died on the job last year. No insurance, no compensation. Just another number in their books. Tell me... tell me, why should I believe you’ll change anything?"\n\nAOC felt her heart sink. \n"I promise you," she said, voice firm, "this administration will fight for you. For all of you.

Around the room, dozens of small business owners—shopkeepers, mechanics, farmers—watched, their faces etched with frustration and fear. With every story, every plea for relief, AOC felt the weight of expectation grow heavier.\n\nA young man stepped forward, his hands still stained with grease from the auto shop he could barely afford to keep open."You talk about taxing the rich, about breaking up the monopolies... but what about us? The ones trying to make an honest living? We’re not billionaires. We’re just trying to survive."\n\nAOC met his gaze, understanding his frustration, his desperation. "I hear you," she said firmly. "And I won’t let you be crushed under the weight of corporate greed. No more backroom deals for Wall Street while Main Street suffers. This administration will stand with you."\n\nA few nods. A few skeptical glances. She would have to prove it."

 bidone.34.d:0 ""I was kicked out when I was sixteen."\n\nThe young man’s voice trembled as he spoke. Around the room, dozens of others listened, nodding in solemn agreement. Some sat with their partners, others alone—trans activists, gay rights organizers, drag performers, and everyday people who had fought just to exist. President Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez sat at the head of the table, hands folded, listening.\n\nA woman, likely in her forties, stepped forward. Her knuckles were white as she clenched the chair in front of her."Madam President, you talk about protecting us. About equality. But what happens when the next administration rolls in? When they erase us again? How do we know you’re not just another politician making promises?"\n\nAOC looked around the room, at the hopeful, tired, and wary faces staring back at her.\n\n"Because this isn’t just politics," she said firmly. "This is about dignity. About justice. And I swear to you—I will not let this country push you back into the shadows. Not now. Not ever."\n\nSome clapped. Some wiped away tears. Others said nothing, waiting to see if her words would hold true."

 bidone.35.d:0 ""My grandfather came here with nothing. Now they tell me I don’t belong."\n\nThe young woman’s voice was steady, but her eyes betrayed the exhaustion of someone who had fought for far too long. Across the crowded community center, dozens of others watched President Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez intently—Black organizers, Latino farmworkers, Indigenous leaders, Asian-American business owners, and immigrants who had built their lives on the promise of the American dream.\n\nA Black man, older, dressed in a suit worn from years of marches and speeches, stepped forward. His voice was tired, but still sharp.\n\n"Madam President, we’ve heard promises before. From both sides. Civil rights, justice, opportunity—we’ve been waiting. So tell me, why should we believe that this time will be any different?"\n\nThe room fell silent. She could feel the weight of history pressing down on her.\n\n"Because this isn’t just about policy," she said firmly. "This is about people. About dignity. About righting centuries of wrongs, not with empty words, but with action. And I will not let this country continue to treat you as second-class citizens."\n\nSome nodded. Some murmured. Others remained skeptical, their trust worn thin by decades of broken promises."

He stared her directly in the eyes and spoke: "Ma’am, I’ll be honest- I served in ‘Nam for five years, a prisoner of war for two of ‘em. I witnessed how communists treat their people, treat their prisoners- how communists run their country. I’m not afraid to hide it; I’m worried you’re sending this here nation in the same direction."\n\nAlexandria hesitated for a moment- she expected to hear something like that eventually, but it still threw her off- then managed to respond: "Sir, I can assure you- we are nothing like the communists of Vietnam, or any communists at all. We are democratic socialists, and unlike the communists, we actually do care for our people, and we will do everything we can to help and support-"\n\n"Y’know, Mr. Sanders said the same thing. Mr. Sanders claimed himself to be a ‘democratic’ socialist… And yet, the last I heard of him, he declared himself ‘Chairman’ of the ‘People’s Republic’. Doesn’t sound all too democratic to me… How can you convince me you’ll be any different-"\n\nBeads of sweat dripped down her forehead. She should’ve known Bernie’s betrayal would’ve come back to haunt her...\n\n"Sir, please- Bernie Sanders was an anomaly and a traitor. It’s true, he was a wolf in sheep’s clothing, but we in the Federal Republic are nothing of the sort-"\n\n"You can say whatever you want. Want me to believe you? Prove it."\n\nThe man got up and walked out, leaving Alexandria alone with nothing but her thoughts and a sinking feeling in her chest."

While both factions agree that deep systemic reform is necessary, they differ on how radical these changes should be. \n\nThe Green-Progressives argue for an eco-social democracy with new constitutional protections for climate action, racial justice, and political transparency. Meanwhile, the Labor-Socialists push for a full-scale economic transformation, seeking constitutional guarantees for worker control, nationalized industries, and a planned economy."

Some NPA leaders fled into exile, while others were imprisoned or forced into hiding.\n\nNow, with the war won and the Trumpist regime defeated, the question of their fate arises.

Some aligned with the Trumpist regime, others fought for personal ambition, and a few sought to carve out independent territories from the ashes of the Union.\n\nNow, the government seeks to hold these warlords accountable. However, many have already fled into exile, vanished into the underground, or continue to wage resistance in isolated pockets of the country. The tribunal proceeds regardless, delivering verdicts in absentia where necessary.

Through television broadcasts, social media, and fiery rallies, they convinced millions to reject democracy, embrace authoritarianism, and take up arms against their fellow citizens. \n\nNow, these figures find themselves facing judgment. Many have fled overseas, seeking refuge in sympathetic nations, while others continue to spread their rhetoric in hiding. The tribunal proceeds regardless, condemning them in absentia if necessary.

These Autocratic Oppressors were not mere soldiers or fanatics; they were the architects and enforcers of a system that sought to dismantle democracy itself. \n\nNow, as the nation rebuilds, the question of justice looms large. Some of these figures have been captured and now stand trial, while others have disappeared—fleeing abroad, hiding within the country, or attempting to quietly reenter political life. Though the tribunal moves forward, many will be sentenced in absentia. How harshly should history judge those who once held the levers of state power?"

 bidone.55.d:0 "While the Trumpist regime and its enablers sought to consolidate power through authoritarianism, the collapse of central authority during the Second American Civil War also gave rise to radical opposition factions. Among them were many movements of militant radicals, left-wing insurrectionists, and anti-state revolutionaries who sought not to restore democracy, but to abolish government altogether. \n\nDuring the war, these groups seized control of city districts, looted government facilities, and waged guerrilla warfare against all factions they deemed oppressive, including the legitimate resistance. Now, as order is restored, the question arises: how should the nation deal with those who rejected all authority? Many of their leaders have gone into hiding, fled abroad, or been absorbed into underground movements, but the tribunal proceeds regardless, convicting them in absentia where necessary."

The guns have fallen silent, the last strongholds of resistance have been pacified, and the government has reasserted control over the entire nation.\n\nNow comes the true test—rebuilding a country not just in infrastructure, but in spirit. The war was not just a battle over territory, but over ideals, and while the victors have emerged triumphant, the wounds of betrayal and destruction will not heal overnight. The world watches to see what kind of nation America will become in the aftermath.\n\nWith the war over, the task of governance begins. The policies enacted now will shape the nation for generations.

He couldn’t believe it, they were threatening the sitting president of the United States of America! As he read the details about how they did it and how they framed the innocent, he was livid. “They can’t get away with this treason” said RFK Jr “I won't let them”. He placed a call to the only person he could trust at this moment, General and Joint Chief of Staff Mark Milley. “Mark, I need your help here” said RFK “With what Mr. President” said Mark Milley” The CIA has just given me evidence they killed my Dad and Uncle Mark, and they are threatening to add me to the list if I say anything or act against them” said RFK “I see, so what's your plan here?” said Mark Milley “I have an idea. I will order an in-person status report for all government agencies, and when all those bastards are in the capital you bring in the troops and arrest them” said RFK “Alright Bobby. Will do.” said Mark Milley. As RFK Jr. hung up the phone he felt nervous, but optimistic for he finally has a chance to avenge his family and end the deep state assassins for good. A few weeks go by and the date is set, today. RFK Jr. has a rally set up in Bethesda Maryland where he will announce all the crimes of the CIA and their arrest and abolishment. He feels good as the arrest confirmation comes in from Milley and he goes out on stage. “My fellow Americans, A great evil has been undone today as the” CRACK THUMP Screams rang out as a third Kennedy lay dead at the hands of the CIA. Back in Washington DC Tanks have rolled onto the White House lawn and the Vice President has disappeared.

Mercenary groups and paramilitary forces, funded by shadowy backers, take to the battlefield, further muddying the lines between war and business. \n\nWith the war dragging on, concerns grow that the Military-Industrial Complex—a force long warned about—has become more than just a supplier of arms.

Supporters have coined the term 'Kamunism', a mix of Harris's name and an emphasis on expansive government programs, designed to uplift working Americans while maintaining a firm grip on national stability.\n\nWhile far from actual communism, Harris's policies prioritize state-led economic reforms, increased social programs, and strong governmental oversight of key industries. Her administration champions worker protections, expanded healthcare, and climate initiatives, but critics—both from the right and within her own party—warn that this level of centralized authority could spiral into overreach.\n\nAs the nation watches, one thing is clear: Kamala Harris is not just another president—she is shaping a new political movement, one that could redefine America for decades to come."

A former prosecutor and attorney general, Harris approaches the war not just as a commander-in-chief, but as a legal enforcer, determined to hold insurrectionists and traitors accountable under the full weight of the law.\n\nHer administration has framed the conflict as not just a battle for control, but as the largest criminal prosecution in American history. Special tribunals, mass indictments, and emergency security laws have become hallmarks of her presidency. Supporters praise her relentless pursuit of justice, ensuring that those who sought to tear the country apart will face the consequences. Detractors, however, fear that in her mission to restore order, she risks consolidating too much power, eroding civil liberties in the name of national security."

Many desire a return to the old standards of the New Deal, using the crisis to our advantage and shifting towards Keynes models of economic development.
