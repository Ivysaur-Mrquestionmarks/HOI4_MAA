 # EVENTS
 bidone.1.t:0 "A Meeting with McConnell"
 bidone.1.d:0 "Early this morning, senate minority leader and defacto leader of the GOP in the Federal Republic of America, Mitch McConnell was invited by President Joe Biden to discuss the future of this great nation. Although the 2 haven’t seen eye-to-eye for most of their lives, it appears that the 2 have formed a unique bond following Trump’s disastrous presidency. \nIt is time for compromise and coming together, not radicalism and polarization."
 bidone.1.a:0 "Together we will crush the orange plum"
 
 bidone.2.t:0 "The First Amendment"
 bidone.2.d:0 "The First Amendment of our constitution grants us one of our greatest liberties: the freedom of speech. However, recently culture war malarkey and the monopoly of social media by a handful of company have put this freedom in jeopardy. It is time we act to protect this liberty we hold so dear to our hearts."
 bidone.2.a:0 "Our Greatest Amendment"
 
 bidone.3.t:0 "The Art of Compromise"
 bidone.3.d:0 "The essence of democracy is founded upon one simple principle: compromise. Yet, in recent years, we’ve seen a steady erosion of this cornerstone, replaced by inflexible ideologies and a deepening chasm between opposing factions. The world today seems ever more fractured, and our political landscape has become a battleground for competing interests, leaving little room for dialogue. It is time to rediscover the delicate balance that once allowed us to move forward as a united people. \n\nThis morning, a remarkable moment unfolded: President Joe Biden extended an olive branch to the leader of the GOP, Mitch McConnell. Despite years of fierce rivalry and discord, they have agreed to meet face-to-face. Both have seen the toll of divisiveness—one that only served to strengthen extremism on all sides. It is clear that the time for harsh rhetoric is over. \n\nAs the two leaders sit down in the heart of the nation’s capital, the eyes of the world are upon them. Will this be the dawn of a new era of cooperation, or will old wounds prove too deep to heal? The challenge is clear: to reignite the spirit of compromise and pull our fractured nation from the brink of self-destruction. The path ahead is uncertain, but one thing is certain: radicalism has failed us. It is time to rebuild, together."
 bidone.3.a:0 "Can't we all just get along?"
 
 bidone.4.t:0 "We Are America!"
 bidone.4.d:0 "We are America! We are the greatest nation to have ever existed! We had the largest economy in the world, the strongest economy in the world. \nWe have the most productive workers in the world! Given a fair shot, given a fair chance, Americans have never, ever, ever, ever let their country down. \nNever. Never!"
 bidone.4.a:0 "Second to none!"
 
 bidone.5.t:0 "We Are America!"
 bidone.5.d:0 "We are America! We are the greatest nation to have ever existed! We had the largest economy in the world, the strongest economy in the world. \nWe have the most productive workers in the world! Given a fair shot, given a fair chance, Americans have never, ever, ever, ever let their country down. \nNever. Never!"
 bidone.5.a:0 "Second to none! And we own the finish line!"
 
 bidone.6.t:0 "A Return to Rational Economics"
 bidone.6.d:0 "Under the previous administration, economic policy was… questionable at best. Tax cuts for the rich while raising them on those with a lower income? Malarkey! \n\nWe must rebuild our economy to make sure that we are a place our youth want to stay in, to grow in, and to fight for! \nWe must re-create the economic system where rationality takes precedence."
 bidone.6.a:0 "And it shall be called 'Bidenomics'"
 
 bidone.7.t:0 "Expanding the Affordable Care Act"
 bidone.7.d:0 "One of the greatest accomplishments of the American government in the 21st century was the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obama Care. Joe Biden will continue Obama’s legacy by expanding on this initiative, giving millions of Americans greater healthcare coverage and cheaper insurance. Healthcare is a right for all, not a privilege."
 bidone.7.a:0 "And you get insurance! And YOU get insurance! Everyone gets insurance!"
 
 bidone.8.t:0 "The Climate Problem"
 bidone.8.d:0 "For the past 2 centuries we have been killing our planet with the burning of toxic gasses releasing carbon dioxide into our atmosphere. This problem is too big to shove away, too big to ignore. We must stop killing our planet. \n\nToday President Joe Biden will sign into law the first of many initiatives aiming at combating climate change, including the decreasing of dependance on fossil fuels and the planting of new trees."
 bidone.8.a:0 "Let it grow, let it grow!"
 
 bidone.9.t:0 "'Malarkey' Files: Guns"
 bidone.9.d:0 "Guns are Malarkey! \n\nIt is undeniable that the former United States has had a problem with guns. We have had more school shootings than every other country combined! Something must be done about this problem. \nThere have also been many members of our military severely injured or killed in rural Pennsylvania attempting to crush rebellions. We may be able to use this as an “excuse” to rid our country of assault rifles - at the bare minimum."
 bidone.9.a:0 "Further Restrictions"
 
 bidone.10.t:0 "'Malarkey' Files: MAGA Movement"
 bidone.10.d:0 "MAGA is Malarkey! \n\nThis extremist, populist ideology has damaged our country nearly beyond repair! It is the very reason why the United States are no longer united! Even the international community recognizes this movement as dangerously extreme. We must deal with them, while they are weak."
 bidone.10.a:0 "America is greater now!"
 
 bidone.11.t:0 "The Malarkey Problem"
 bidone.11.d:0 "Malarkey is everywhere! \n\nPresident Donald Trump left this country in a state of ruin and extreme damage, and it is now up to us to fix it. We need to clean up the Malarkey and dispose of it, making America great again for all our people, we will rise again! \n\nWait...\n\nWAIT A SECO-"
