 city_conquest.1.d:0 "Reports have come in from the city of Indianapolis that [USA.GetAdjective] troops have finally captured the city.  [NPA.GetAdjective] resistance was strong with the attackers being forced to sweep the city building by building.  Although they fought hard, their lackluster equipment was no match for the overpowering might of the attackers who managed to squeeze out the defenders.  Former Vice President Pence is presumed to be killed following a heroic last stand on the battlefield.  His body has not been recovered yet but it is expected that the attackers will find his corpse soon."

 cascadia.1.d:0 "The Worst has happened! Our former allies in New Awakening have infiltrated the Resistance Council far more than ever could have been expected, and they have now launched a coup to oust all non-aligned members of the council!\n\nWe had not expected this level of cohesion."
 cascadia.1.a:0 "We are powerless to stop them."
 cascadia.1.b:0 "Rally the resistance! We have a new foe!"
 cascadia.2.t:0 "Seattle Peace Accords"
 cascadia.2.d:0 "As the PRA delegates arrive in our capitol, they almost immediately brought up the question of Seattle. As a city, Seattle has been in chaos ever since the beginning of the George Floyd protests, that was until they declared full support for the Sanderists cause and pledged to fight until the death for an America that was truly equal. The occupation of this city will be a pain in the ass for our government. If we let the P.R.A. keep Seattle, we will likely be able to keep our independence in the event of a People's Republic victory against Biden and Trump."

 cascadia.3.d:0 "With the evergrowing grip of the Chinese Communist advisors over our government, many in our distant land of Seattle have been pushing for autonomy from our government in the chance that we fall to the Chinese influence.

 cascadia.4.t:0 "What to do with the army?"
 cascadia.4.d:0 "So far, the Cascadian Army has been completely unresponsive to our coup. This could be a good thing- they are apathetic and do not really care. This could also be a bad thing- they are plotting against us. What's most obvious, however, is they are fully under the direction of Marshal Raymond Rees. Many across our country, regardless of political affiliation, consider him a hero. His influence in the army is even more intense. Whatever he says, goes. He is the Kingmaker."
 cascadia.4.a:0 "Let Rees have his army, he is no threat."
 cascadia.4.b:0 "'Promote' him to an entirely ceremonial role with no power."
 cascadia.5.t:0 "Rees is Enraged!"
 cascadia.5.d:0 "After hearing of his relegation to a ceremonial role, Rees apparently became livid and immediately contacted known supporters of a countercoup! It turned out this was the absolute worst thing we could do short of outright firing the man! Professional soldiers loyal only to Marshal Rees now swarm into Portland, and our local Brown Shirts are unable to keep up, especially with the popular support and literally crowds of people jumping on them during the chaos."

 CasElection.1.t:0 "The Continuing Search"
 CasElection.1.d:0 "It has been well over a month now into the search for a rightful King of Cascadia, and Marshal Rees has called council with the committee to see where they have gotten so far. One man suggested Eduard Habsburg- definitely of good stock, of noble birth, willing to accept the crown, he would be--\n\n"He's not American, though, is he? Let alone Cascadian." Rees' words silenced that committee member. Another member hesitantly spoke up about various significant families within Oregon and Washington who can trace their lineage back to old English--\n\n"But are any of them the sort of stock we want on our noble crown?" The room fell silent."I thought not." Rees stood, and walked to the window overlooking Portland. Is there truly nobody fit for the task? Is my committee staffed with fools? He suddenly heard a young member pipe up before being silenced by his colleagues. Rees turned around."You there. What do you have for me?"\n\nThe Young man trembled slightly, as he watched the look of utter disdain across his comrades. After a brief moment, he uttered out, "Well, sir, there is one man. A native who has proven himself to be of immense character and more than fit for the job."\n\n"And who would that be? Come on boy, spit it out!"\n\n"Well, sir, it would be, umm, it would be you, sir.""
 CasElection.1.a:0 "What a preposterous suggestion. An Empty Throne, it is."
 CasElection.1.b:0 "If there is truly nobody else, I shall do it."
 CasElection.2.t:0 "Rees Travels to Tokyo"
 CasElection.2.d:0 "He felt bad, visiting another country while his was in such chaos and bloodshed. But this visit was important. In the search for a monarch to sit on the throne of Cascadia, Rees was taking himself to Japan to petition the Chrymastheum Throne to accept Cascadia as a loyal subject. He wasn't the biggest fan of being under the thumb of the Japs, but they were embarking on a renewed Imperial Army program and their geographical relation to Cascadia was more than obvious. The Chinese had California, so the Japanese would have Cascadia.\n\nThere were a lot of things Rees didn't like that he'd done before, mind. This was nothing in comparison."
 CasElection.2.a:0 "Bowing Before a Jap, it is, then."
 CasElection.3.t:0 "King of All Cascadians"
 CasElection.3.d:0 "The day had finally come. Rees had never expected but a year ago that he ever would have be in a situation such as this. But it was happening. Today, Raymond Rees, Marshal of Cascadia, Saviour from the Nazi Coup, Defender Against Bolshevism, would embrace a title that would supercede all those honours."
 CasElection.3.a:0 "Today, he would be king."
 CasElection.4.t:0 "Regency Eternal"
 CasElection.4.d:0 "Lord-Protector. Huh. Had a nice ring to it. It's not like his job was going to change much. He had his army, and now he also had a state. Kinda like those Russians he read about. Or was it Prussians? Something like that. Whatever. None of that mattered. What mattered was the task ahead.\n\nRees had never been one for civilian affairs, so he enacted a sort of Laissez-Faire style of management. Other than dealing with the Army, he would sit in his office in Portland, and allow the needy to petition him for various efforts. To be honest, he didn't care much at all. But if it meant he could have his precious army, well..."
 CasElection.4.a:0 "So Be it."
 CasElection.5.t:0 "Formation of the Liberal Party"
 CasElection.5.d:0 "Utilising the upcoming elections, what used to be CascadiaNow have merged with the remnants of the old Democratic Party to form the Liberal Party of Cascadia. After a short Party conference, Jay Inslee was elected to head this new party."
 CasElection.5.a:0 "Up the Liberals!"
 CasElection.6.t:0 "Formation of the Tory Party"
 CasElection.6.d:0 "The Formation of the Liberal Party has inspired remnants of the Old Republican Party to also band back together, creating the Cascadian Tory Party. The name difference is due to their desire to dissassociate completely from Trump."
 CasElection.6.a:0 "We're not like him!"
 CasElection.7.t:0 "MacArthur's Return"
 CasElection.7.d:0 "Something incredibly unexpected has occurred right in the midst of Election Season. Arthur MacArthur IV, the famed son of Douglas MacArthur and notorious for being practically impossible to find, has come out of hiding to announce his candidacy for the Presidential Election. In his announcement speech, he emphasised the importance of a strong army but the moral obligation of the state to embrace a Free-Market economy as well as the individual state rights of Oregon and Washington. Afterwards, he met with several dissident civic right leaders, forming a broad coalition of Libertarians, Trumpists and Reagan-Era conservatives to form the Whig Party of Cascadia."
 CasElection.7.a:0 "He has returned!"
 CasElection.8.t:0 "The Election"
 CasElection.8.d:0 "After a hard-fought campaign season, the climax has finally arrived as voters swarm into polling stations to cast their votes. Initially meant to be a relatively uneventful easy win for the Liberals, MacArthur's return and Blitz Campaign strategy totally upset the numbers, turning it into anyone's gain. MacArthur has achieved a great deal of popularity in such a short period of time, but will it be enough to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat? The Liberals are also concerned about the new electoral behemoth, and their otherwise easy victory was smashed completely. The Tories, too, saw their opportunity to swoop into power off the broken backs of a tired Whig and Liberal Party. Of course, the Greens are not completely counted out yet either, although many fear the best they could do is split the progressive vote and hand power to the Tories or the Whigs. But who shall ultimately come out on top?"
 CasElection.8.a:0 "The Liberals!"
 CasElection.8.b:0 "The Tories!"
 CasElection.8.c:0 "The Whigs!"
 CasElection.8.e:0 "The Greens!"
 CasElection.9.t:0 "Return of the Green Party"
 CasElection.9.d:0 "Despite many of their members leaving to join the People's Republic to the South, the Green Party has announced they will be running candidates in the upcoming elections. The most unlikely of all the parties to win, the Greens are banking on the Tory-Whig divide splitting the vote enough for them to get an edge over their true rival, the Liberals. They operate on a policy of Unionism with the South."
 CasElection.9.a:0 "For a Green World!"

 California.1.d:0 "Raz closes his window shades, obscuring himself from the crowds of people cheering his name outside, although being leader of Seattle was stressful, it had its perks. It was an unusually cold and quiet night in Seattle, perfect for an early night, cozy in the most luxurious linens and blankets the remaining coffers of Seattle could buy. \n\nA gunshot rang out through the night, practically shocking Raz awake, he thought it sounded unusually close, for the sole fact that the grounds of the Capital building were teeming with loyalist bodyguards.

 California.2.d:0 "Bernie Sanders was forced to appear in front of the people who supported him, the office was in a darkened atmosphere as representatives of the Sanders administration approached their seats. At the head of the Chinese delegation, there was silence, eagerly waiting to hear the report from Sanders, previously asking him to fulfill the obligations he gave them, within which he had a set deadline to ensure Maoism had a place in the New America. Sanders knew that the Chinese would be angry with his moves to Democratize the country after all the support and U.N. Shit they went through to help him against the Fleet. When he told them his plans for Democratization, the room fell silent. Dissatisfied with the work that this administration was doing, very unsuccessfully, the delegate demanded something that both sides knew could never be fulfilled, impossible both during unity and during the rapid spreading of dissent. Sanders tried everything to make the Chinese delegation come to its senses, but they did not want to give up their idea and intention to repay all the debts invested in this Sanders project. The meeting lasted in full swing for the next hour, full of tensions over agreements, new promises, old lies, and nothing new except the look of eyes that were supposed to persuade the Chinese delegation to deviate from debt collection. Everything was in vain. In the end, the Chinese decided to slap the Sanders administration, knowing that they had no money to pay off the debts, saying the following: "For good intentions and good service to remain as it is now, we will have to approach the collection of your debts by different methods. We demand the following service from you - we want our government's full right and complete control over the ports of San Francisco. ""

A well dressed man, clad in green military garb and sunglasses stepped onto the dusty podium in the center of Pheonix, crowds gathered around as the man seemed as though he knew what was happening in San Fransisco. "Dear people of the great state of Arizona, we are addressing you as proud citizens who will not tolerate what a foreign power imposes on them, and that is occupation. An incompetent government brought occupation to American soil for the first time after 200 years of our independence and invincibility! To ensure what God and the nation have given us, we must do what is hardest in our hearts, we will have to tear our state, even more, to save it because it is better to die poor and hungry than under the steel boots of a communist dictator! I am now speaking to you as a representative of the nation, as one of you, ready to fight for the independence of the Arizona Culture, to do my best, to do what is left of us after the great destruction of American society. I stand proudly before you, claiming that this is a struggle between freedom and slavery, between life and death, between our nation and the foreign occupier! We stand here united around the idea of ​​saying the following words in their faces: We will never obey your aspirations! We die and fall together, NEVER!

Before anyone could even comprehend what was happening, the shots, oh God the shots rang out and in that moment Eric became no more than an empty body.\n\n“Now, Barron Trump,” the priest said, jolting him out of his bleak memories into an only slightly less bleak moment. “Do you want to say anything about your brother?” He gestured for him to come up to the platform where the priest and the coffin were.\n\nBarron nodded, coming up the steps and trying not to stare at the well-crafted coffin, the best that money could buy. If only there was a way to buy Eric’s return. He turned to face the crowd, his face morose and still. His eyes caught on Jeb, who was murmuring quietly to a few other men next to him in the crowd, pausing slightly as he noticed Barron’s gaze, before continuing the conversation, too quiet for him to make out what they were saying.\n\n“My brother may not have been perfect,” he started his speech, his mind immediately coming up with several mistakes he had made as he led Florida. “But he did the best he could, especially in the chaotic times we live in. I’m sure nobody here is glad he is gone-” Did he hear a snicker? Or was he just being paranoid? “But we cannot change what happened to him. We can only carry on and hope we can do what is best for us and all of our people.” He bowed his head to look at his black, polished shoes, making sure to squash his emotions. How could he seem like a capable leader if he started bawling his eyes out?\n\nA few claps came from assorted people in the crowd, quiet to try and not disturb the mood of the occasion as Barron moved down from the platform where his brother lay, glad to have that over with.

Instead of doing any good, fighting Confederates or Commies, he was making sure these officers didn't get some rocks thrown at them by frustrated schoolchildren. Well, at least Barron was making moves against them. That was something at least. Rico thought about his disappointment in Jeb, however. He couldn't believe he voted for that worm into the governorship all those years ago. Although these days, voting seemed like a distant memory.\n\nThe Officer finally reached Rico, and interrupted his thoughts. "You there, Corporal. Where do your loyalties lie in this civil war?" Rico snorted. He hated these types of people. His loyalty is being questioned, undoubtedly by a man whose loyalties were to the rebellious Governor and not to the rightful Leader.

He could not open his eyes nor could he think normally from the torture he suffered. Every step would upset him to flinch in fear thinking that Judgment Day had come for him. Spreading through the cells, the sound of the creaking of a metal door woke him from the sleep he so desperately wanted to get. Hitting the wall and the bars with his fingers, Jeb knew who was coming to visit him again. He turned to his side to see what he had to see every third day of the week. Barron ran his hand over the fence that separated him from Jeb, who said with suffering in his voice, "Not you ... not you again, you motherfucker ..."\n\n"Open the door." Barron told the guard, who turned the keys in search of the right one. After the door is opened, Jeb tried to escape towards the wall, visibly frightened and distraught by Barron's appearance. "Get on your feet, you useless bag of fleas!" He yelled at him, kicking him in the stomach and grabbing him by the collar. Jeb only succumbed to this silence and did not intend, nor did he have the strength to get up. Knowing that Jeb would not get up, he pulled him towards him and threw him to the ground, now even harder than he had kicked him the first time. "I don't have time to lose, get up!" He yelled at him until Jeb intended to give up his helpless lying on the cold concrete as Barron screamed his name, demanding he not be a poor coward. "If you could get away with it and declare war, take this as a continuation of the war!" He yelled again, kicking him directly in the spine, while Jeb moaned with all his might, begging for mercy. "There is no mercy for the traitors of the regime!" He continued, not giving in. Jeb tried to lift himself against the wall with his hand, but Barron prevented him from doing so by stepping on his hand with a heavy military boot, breaking his bones into small pieces. Jeb no longer had the strength, he had to surrender, and this was no longer interesting to Barron either, and he realized that his torture would lose its sharpness if he continued.

Why are you doing this to me?!" Patrick begged, looking up at the sky. Out of rage, he no longer knew what to do, so he immediately ran away from the camp, moving towards the city, to see his name "PRODATOR" all around him, pasted all over the city. "What the hell?" Patrick asked himself, looking at the billboards. "This is not happening. This is not happening, I swear by my life." Everything he had so far, he lost.

Grasping his shoulder and lifting him off the ground, he pushed him forward, bringing him back into balance. "Walk you pig." He told him briefly, ignoring the surroundings. Donald was waiting for them in the main room, which was right at the entrance to the building. "I brought you something as a present." Barron said from the doorway as Donald looked back in his direction. "I think you'll like this toy more than I liked it." He added to the previous sentence as Donald made a satisfied, albeit also somewhat disturbed, expression on his face and extended his hand to him, congratulating him on this one.\n\n"You're telling the truth, this is going to be the perfect trophy for my conquests." Donald said, looking at Jeb as some kind of commodity, a slither of pity slipping through his iron gaze before remembering all that Jeb had done to try and overthrow him. "I like it.

Barron noticed this, but didn't feel the need to point it out.\n\n"Your job is not complex. Your job is simple- propaganda. Your job is to make us have a 'good' voice and to make sure that the unpopularity of other people is maintained at the current, even lower level. Understand?" Barron tried to be what he had always been, quiet and withdrawn, cold but active.\n\nSam was looking at him and thinking, "Woah, I am Barron's top man. I am Barron's top man. This doesn't happen every day." Turning in the opposite direction. "I could be Barron's guy for stuff ... yes, that would be really something. Being his man. Top man. I'm just going to have to work hard for this." He continued to talk to himself as he walked down the hall. "Washington is for pussies. I'm gonna be like Stonewall Jackson.

"The best example of this was Thomas Jefferson. He did not want to use his position to remove the idea of ​​slavery, although he had the possibilities and space for such maneuvering, but his basic idea, which he implemented in 1802 with the White Act, remained hidden behind the scenes. neoliberal American policy which made it clear that slavery was universal in the sense that it represented more white people as slaves than blacks, leading us to the new conclusion that the post-Washington administration had a very clear intention to subjugate not only blacks but all races, which is one of the provisions of the White Act of 1802 that we have already mentioned. Slavery is not determined by race. Slavery is determined by human decisions that lead to bad or criminal acts. " These were the last words of the teacher who closed the book while showing a copy of the ‘White Act of 1802’ signed by Thomas Jefferson.

It arrived at lunchtime and today on offer was moldy bread with one small glass of water from a local swamp they were pumping so that the water could go to unspoiled citizens in Miami and larger cities like Savannah.

He was a bit annoyed that he wasn't being referred to as 'president', as he should be, but he wasn't exactly in a position to demand formalities.\n\n"Sit down, George, tell me why you came to me?" It was his words, taking his eyes off what he had been doing so far and looking directly at George.\n\n"He needs your help, Cruz. That silver-spoon fed son of even the bastard that started all this can fall Cruz if you decide to follow my advice. Jeb led an armed rebellion against him, but he possibly win on his own." George W.

Both Biden and Trump count on our cooperation. \n\nThe first step of our "new government" should be to determine whether or not we are to continue to be bound by the old constitution - by calling new elections, following Biden or Trump.

 montana.7.d:0 "We thought that the greatest threat to our rule would be the democrats. It is ironic that they have become the strongest faction that supports our rule today. \n\nLife in our state has returned to the old, pre-war times. They all seem to be working for our new country, and supporting our claims. It seems there won't be any protests, nor uprisings anymore."
 montana.7.a:0 "We stand united as never before!"
 montana.8.t:0 "The Great Migration"
 montana.8.d:0 "Though the protests have stopped following our military intervention, it seems that cities and larger regions are deserted.

Estimates show that we have lost half the population, with another being semi-content with our choices. At least Republicans seem to be happy. \n\nFor a while."

 montana.9.t:0 "Canada at war!"
 montana.9.d:0 "At a completely unexpected moment, the authorities of independent Montana declared a state of war with Canada, accusing it of violating their country's sovereignty. This is most likely related to the "Great Migration crisis", in which Canadians agreed to grant asylum to repressed Montana residents. \n\nCanadian authorities calls for an immediate cessation of fire, requesting UN crisis summit on immediate intervention in the escalating, dangerous conflict in Northern America."

 montana.10.t:0 "Montana Wants to Establish Trade Routes"
 montana.10.d:0 "The government of independent Montana turned to us with a request to open new trade routes through our country. This is probably related to the difficult situation in the US. \n\n While other factionsa fighting over US may condemn this action, separate trade treaties with Montana could fuel our economy, which is lacking resources. We lost our former trade routes since the collapse of the USA, and this might be a good opportunity to restore the trade at least partially."

 montana.11.t:0 "Canada Opens Trade Routes"
 montana.11.d:0 "Canada has decided to open trade routes on the condition that we do not involve them in any conflict taking place in America. They would also like to point out that they want to remain neutral, and although they consider our country independent, they will approach it with necessary caution. \n\nTrade agreements with them will be broken if any of our countries get into any conflict."
 montana.11.a:0 "Reasonable and good"
 montana.12.t:0 "Canada Rejects Our Proposal"
 montana.12.d:0 "After longer than expected time, we received correspondence in which the Canadian authorities decided to refuse to open the borders. The main reason for this decision was Canada's willingness to remain neutral in the face of the conflict taking place in America. \n\nOur diplomats assume the real reason may be a reluctance to support Montana due to the likely consequences from larger factions fighting over USA."
 montana.12.a:0 "Shame on them"
 montana.13.t:0 "Intervention in Cascadia"
 montana.13.d:0 "The situation in Cascadia is, to put it mildly - tense. The disorganized temporary staff of generals clearly needs help, and is willing to sacrifice a great deal to end the rebellion against the socialist ideals of the south. Sanderists are on the other side of the barricade, restlessly fighting for the coast. Both sides seem to have equal chances of winning. \n\nWe have many options. On the tactical side, it would be good and deadly to invade and then split Cascadia between us and the Sanderists. However, guided by political motives, we should support Cascadia, or even try to take control over it - if only they agree to our rule. They are desperate enough to not deny."

 montana.14.a:0 "Excellent news"
 montana.15.t:0 "Montana Sends Volunteers"
 montana.15.d:0 "The authorities of the neighboring state of Montana have decided to help us in the fight against Sanderism developing in America by sending some of their men willing to aid us in fight. In order not to remain in debt, our authorities quickly decided to reciprocate this gesture by recognizing and guaranteeing Montana's independence."
 montana.15.a:0 "It's good to have such neighbour"
 montana.16.t:0 "Montana Offers ''Protection''"
 montana.16.d:0 "The Montana authorities have contacted us about our war. Unfortunately, there was a strange aggression in their tone. These authorities wish to cooperate in return for an offer to protect our state from the sanderists, and to preserve our autonomy by partially taking power over our military staff. In practice, this means that they would like to take over our rebellion using its opportunity to expand - not to help us. \n\nGiving them control over our army will de facto lead to our annexation, and it seems they are military preparing for us to decline the offerm just to seize us, by force."
 montana.16.a:0 "We are not falling for this!"
 montana.16.b:0 "Our lives always had a price"
 montana.17.t:0 "Cascadia Accepts Our Lead"
 montana.17.d:0 "The Cascadian forces expressed their support for our protection, that is, our political leadership. Although it was not because of friendship, but because of a fear of a potential war on two fronts that they would not survive - the inhabitants of Cascadia accepted their fate, hoping that on their behalf we would end war with Sanderists quickly."
 montana.17.a:0 "They will rejoice soon"
 montana.18.t:0 "Cascadia Accepts Resists"
 montana.18.d:0 "The forces of the Cascadia decided to oppose any attempts at our interference, assuming in advance that we were no different from Sanderists - in a similar way trying to enslave the free people of Cascadia. he rebels swore they would open fire on any attempt to enforce submission by us."

Mullet was suggested to replace him as the New Montana glorious leader. Since both leaders appear to be supermatist authorities, we should make a choice.

It is a process that should be properly directed to allow it to produce appropriate results in the future. \n\nWe need to choose between financing rural hospitals, or those in urban areas. The choice is hard, as both countrymen and city inhabitants are important to us. Investment in city healthcare would allow the rest of our heath institutions to focus on science, while helping countrymen would give us some support of theirs, and definately more of saved manpower."

 montana.29.t:0 "Montana Joins Trump's Loyalists"
 montana.29.d:0 "Some, wondering about the future of an independent Montana, were unsure of its direction. Ultimately, it turned out that the game to achieve independence was more of an attempt to disguise his allegiance to Trump's forces. Following today's secret leadership meeting, an alliance was formally forged to include Montana in the ever-expanding Loyalists' front. \n\n Trump sees this as a great step towards the unification of America's interests, while [MON.GetLeader] sees it as a great opportunity for expansion and ''restoration'' of the Northwest Territorial Imperative."

There was a grand debate among the admiralty and higher ups as to where to get their supplies. Canada was too much of a hot mess to lend much of anything and it would be a sin to deal with the Chinese or Russians. Supplies had to come from the former states, but  where we will get those supplies could show the world our leanings. We must choose carefully in order to show the world what our ideologies are."

They have accomplished something that they deemed based on their situation was impossible.\nChampagne was popped, cigars were lit, sailors sung songs of returning home, everyone onboard was ecstatic to hear the news. Admiral John C. Aquilino took a deep breath and interrupted the celebrations to make a speech. The room quited immediately as everyone was eager to hear what he had to say.\nLadies and gentlemen, we may have taken California, we may have liberated the West Coast from Bolshevism.

As he set up the zoom meeting he began to speak with the different chains of his command. Many issues were discussed but there was one debate he had to settle. There were two active factions within the fleet, the Army and the Militia. The Army was composed mostly of former US Marines and were the bulk of the land forces responsible for taking down Sanders. On one hand they were extremely organized and loyal but on the other they are not very popular amongst the newly conquered Californians. The Militia is a loose term given to the various freedom fighter groups that fought alongside the Army against the regime. They were responsible for sabotage, espionage, assassination and were crucial in urban conflicts. While they lack any proper discipline or training they are seen in more of a favorable light than that of the Army. One of these factions needs to be followed in order to end this power struggle in the fleet. Both sides had made very convincing arguments to the Admiral, but after a few hours of debate he settled on….."

Matthews could tell when he was in trouble. There was always a tone in the Admirals voice depending on his emotions, but this time he genuinely had no idea what he wanted.\nI wanted to talk to you about an idea I had. Consider this Commander Matthews, a strong state, a strong and patriotic state. One that didn’t bow down to Liberals in New York or Conservatives in Oklahoma. A state where decisions weren’t made by a whiny orange bastard or a elderly decrepit fool. There would be no contestation against this new state as it worked for everyone as much as everyone worked for it. There would be no two party bullshit, the only shit that would matter is keeping the lights on and the people happy. This is what I would like to see in a new America. Not one where people burn the American flag or replace it with one of political demagoguery…. But one where they stand and salute… or else. It would not be a failed union of states or a petty republic, no. It would, be one, unitary state. One American State! the Admiral said as he took a long drag out of a pipe he took as a souvenir from Sander’s office.\nPermission to speak Admiral… asked the Commander fearfully.

He had taken refuge in a small villa just outside of Hollywood. The home must have belonged to some celebrity or influencer, either way it was his now. As he walked out to the balcony he saw in his court yard roughly 30 or so men, armed and wearing balaclavas. When they saw him they got into some kind of formation and offered a salute to him. Taken back and confused, he put down his coffee and gave a salute back.\nLike what you see Admiral Aquilino, this is one of the more finer militia divisions we have, '' one of his Captains said as he looked up to him. “Based on recruitment numbers and supplies we can get roughly 3 of these made every month, he added.\nJohn liked what he was seeing here, but he decided that it was too early to deal with business so he shouted back a response that saved him another 5 hour zoom call."

One that favored civilians, which could be seen as popular with the militias. The other favored the military, which is a popular proposal with the military.

After the Canadian representative joined and spoke briefly, the Admiral had begun to ask his question.\nIt’s no secret, the fleet is in desperate need for their supplies. I will not lie to you my friend the issue of where to get the supplies has become a debate within the fleet. The European Union wanted nothing to do with the fleet, there was no recognition with the UN and there was no way in hell we were taking supplies from those bastards in Moscow or Beijing.

There was one character in his book that did catch his eye as he saw him as quite comparable to himself. His name was Alexander Kolchak, a naval Admiral from the far east who ruled his warlord state as a Supreme Leader. What Admiral Aquillino was confused about was the book was making him out to seem like a bad guy, but after thinking more about him he began to empathize with his situation in the book. He then finished the chapter he was on as he walked up to his mirror to take a look at himself. He envisioned himself wearing a bright white uniform adorned with medals and awards. He imagined a bright white Admiral’s hat with the crest of his fleet and various national symbols. He thought of having a decortational saber on his hip, dress pants and the nicest black dress shoes money could buy. And then he thought to himself the title of Supreme Leader…..

After the Mormon victory, a large number of Republicans left Utah in search of salvation, at the same time seeking help for the country they lost.

Joaquin Guzman, better known as El Chapo, led an army composed of his mercenaries from Mexico and American associates and attacked Mormon guerrilla positions from the direction of White River City - Vernal, but the real details of that conflict are not known yet. Until tensions across America continue to rise and as it destroys itself, we are left to wonder - will anything remain in the end? Is anything sacred?"

The meeting that handed him actual power had been a baffling one, if any words were to describe it. 'Here you go, Mr. Baugh. You're in charge now. Real power,' said the council, and, quite frankly, he thought it a joke as well. But then war started happening. News from the East and West of domestic terrorism and American fighting American. And then people started pouring in. Maybe it was the wikipedia articles, maybe it was the silly film he had taken part in, but people wanted refuge, and what could Kevin Baugh do but oblige? More people showed up. Some with tents, some with only the clothes on their backs, and some with even less. Defectors from the world over, not Republican, not Democrat, but American. Baugh welcomed them with blankets and open arms. His Vice President and wife had been a godsend in this time as well, for every person that came in she came in, asking names, if they needed help, or even just a phone call. Most were happy to find peace, maybe for a few days, maybe a month, even. But as the tensions rose, more people found themselves staying. Kevin Baugh found himself with real legitimacy, and when he had asked for more land, more help, the neighboring cities, floundering in their own right, joined in. They turned a ghost town into a real settlement, and A town of four hundred into four thousand. Change was coming to the Republic of Molossia. Baugh only hoped he could meet it with a steady hand."

Baugh closed his eyes and took a look at his hand. \n\nTwo-Seven, both of a different suit. It was nothing. The General grinned, too. He waited for the three cards to be put up, maybe he had a chance if they were just- \n\nAn ace, a king, and a nine. The General grinned wider.

The one with the A in the corner. He was expressionless, though. That rule he knew. She put another card on the table. A two. Walker didn't know what to make of that, but she put down the final card, another ace, and the General revealed his hand.

Ideas ran through his head. He considered just leaving the system in place, just to see what would happen. But this wasn't a nation of test subjects, it was a nation of people, and something needed to be done. His eyes settled on a map on his wall, listing out the nearby settlements. Before everything went to hell, there was a nearby town, Hawthorne. Really an extension of the nearby army base, but a town nonetheless.

Something even more suprising was the revival of a ghost town nearby, called Luning. People had seen the abandoned buildings and got to work, and it too became a functioning settlement.

It had been a grueling event, to have his nation torn apart by whatever advisor he could find walking among the tents of the various new settlements popping up left and right, the only promise of payment being a warm meal and extra blankets, and he had had his legal code torn to shreds, but at least he knew what to do." #placeholder

However, it only became five times as chaotic with the outbreak of war to the North.\n\nMexico had relied almost entirely on the United States for food imports, and entered a state of famine as soon as the American Civil War began. Through corruption and overall greed, the Mexican government failed to fix the issue, and protests turned into riots as armed militia groups began taking control of the country. Now, the nation is in full revolt, as the conservative PAN sides with the rebels and wages conflict against ruling MORENA."

The body of Former President Donald J. Trump was not found, but his eyepatch, wallet and Left Foot was found in the rubble.. Trump's America is no more, just as his vision and tyrrany. \n\nLots of Americans from Trump's States with less radical views thanked us for liberating their states from the occupation. Biden, although we counted for his support, had not congratulated our government its victory.

It was nothing pristine, but given the current situation of this great country, it was a great luxury that the President had afforded him. It had a wonderful view- on one side, the beautiful Idaho countryside, on the other, the industrious city of Twin Falls. These two views reminded him why he was here. The President needed him. He was the man for the job. He needed to protect the people who lived within the Command Zone, and he needed to prepare them for the coming struggle.\n\nHis leuitenants came to him with two main plans. The first, to organise private enterprise and industry, like proper Red-Blooded capitalist Americans, and the rifles would follow. However, the other plan considered the rifle shortage. A solution was needed, quick, and not something that could wait for market forces.\n\nSo as Stankiewicz looked out one window, then out the other, he took in those sights which kept him going, and decided."

Sheriff McGovern didn't really care for politics, and he didn't really care who ruled over him, but things were only going to get worse from here.\n\nSuddenly, he heard a ruckus brewing in the street. The townspeople gathered round the dirt road that the settlement was built on. A trail of dust building in the distance. The sound of marching feet. About a hundred, maybe a few more than a hundred, uniform clad men marching right down into their little town.\n\nSheriff McGovern stood in the middle of the road, and the uniformed men stopped. The man McGovern assumed to be their leader stepped forward towards the weary old Sheriff. McGovern asked loudly- "Who are you, then?" the leader of the uniformed men took a step forward and replied;"

 idaho.4.d:0 "Mark looked down at his watch, Jeff was already 20 minutes late. The two Governors looked at each other with a level of nervousness, thoughts of him standing them up flooded both their minds. They agreed to meet at this park before sunset and it was now nearly dark. Jeff Stankiewicz had ruled the area like a general rather than an administrator. They worried that he would be too busy making over-ambitious warplans like usual and forgot about this meeting they fought to have. After ten more minutes, Jeff and his posse would eventually meet them, naturally dressed up in their finest military surplus and brandishing their AR-15s.\n\n“You two better have a damn good reason as to why you called me out here today”, Jeff snarled at the governors as his men watched on. \n\nBrad looked at Mark and took a deep breath as he collected himself. He knew what they were about to propose might not go down brilliantly. He collected himself and began to speak.\n\n“Democracy. This country was founded on free and fair elections and democracy. And this party, our party, the Republican party, was the party of both Idaho and Wyoming. Forget about Trump or Biden for a second and take a look at the interior. Is this what America would have wanted?” Mark said with a level of confidence that had arisen from his mental preparation. \n\nBefore Jeff could cut him off Brad began to continue their speech. “We are not asking you to stop your militia, or stop your fight against the Communists or Liberals or Democrats, we are not asking you to even step down from having a government role. But we are asking you to return genuine civilian rule. You can let your men roam the streets and we are willing to look the other way, but we are asking for a new election, a new state, one that Lincoln would be proud of. Jeffrey, you started your militia to ‘fight for the people’ so here is your chance to be their champion. I am begging you, we are begging you, give us back the ballot”. Brad stated nearly out of breath from the anxiety from his response. \n\nStankiewicz began to ponder the request of these men, he then even began to ponder everything he had fought so hard to build and his beliefs. The governor was right, he formed his militia to fight for a great America, but America nonetheless. He pulled out a cigar and lit it, and with his first exhale he looked to his men and gave them his response:"

 idaho.6.b:0 "There are other things to consider."
 idaho.7.t:0 "The Final Broadcast"
 idaho.7.d:0 "Jeff was skeptical of his decision he made. He could have just ruled his little rump state until the president wanted their return. Nevertheless, it was too late now. As his men operating the news cameras in his home began to roll he looked into the camera and began to speak.\n\n“My fellow patriots, it would be a fair statement to say these past few years have been very difficult for our country. I am here to announce that for this party of the former United States we shall create a new mandate of liberty. This land shall be known as Lincoln, he would have never wanted to see our country divide the way it did so it is only best to honor him that way. I am effectively stepping down as Head Commander and effective leadership of the Western Command Zone following both the first debates and elections. God bless you all and God bless….. Lincoln”.

After some back and forth and carefully asked questions by both moderators and the audience, the debate began to wind down to a close. Brad Little would finish his opening remarks and which lead to the moderators gesturing to Mark to begin his. Mark looked into the camera and began to speak to not just the people there tonight but both the people at home and watching abroad as well. There was something about Mark Gordon that the people liked. In 2016, many members of the audience voted for Trump because he was an outsider from Washington. Mark Gordon may have been the Governor of Wyoming but he will always be seen as what he really is, a New Yorker with a dream. Based on how well he did in this first debate, it looks like the people of Lincoln may want to follow this man’s dream. \n\n“No longer shall we face the mobs of the left and right or the anarchy of collapse. No longer shall we walk the streets in fear from radicals. No longer shall we be seen by any administration as just unclaimed land for their fiefdoms or despotates. This debate and election is not just about the welcome return of democracy. It is about telling the remnants of America and the world that we are more than just Americans; we are Lincolinites. And anyone who questions that will be dealt with accordingly. God bless us all and God Bless Lincoln”. Gordon announced as he concluded his final remarks.\n\nThe audience arose in applause as the two Governors shook hands and departed the stage. In the early stages of this election, Mark Gordon had taken an early lead."

 idaho.9.t:0 "Little Stands Victorious in Second Debate"
 idaho.9.d:0 "After a heated yet civil debate, the people of Lincoln watched as both Governors debated over the path’s they wanted to take this new country down. With the debate slowly coming to a close, both candidates were asked for their closing statements. Mark Gordon would go first and give a calming yet hopeful closing statement that awarded him minor applause from the audience. What Brad Little was about to say would cement his position of power for years to come. Little walked down from his podium and began to speak to the audience from the center of the stage. He had spent years as a politician and knew how to speak to such a crowd even without a mic or a speech written beforehand. It was just him, the moderators and the cameras rolling.\n\n“Just a few years ago this country was devastated and torn asunder like that of the Civil War from the days of old. If we citizens of Lincoln do not learn from the sins of the previous governments we are doomed to follow a similar fate. A great man once said, ‘A house divided amongst itself cannot stand’ and to that I think we can all agree on that. The house of this great nation was divided and thus fell, with this new country, with this new house, let’s make sure it shall never fall”.\n\nThere was a brief silence as he said his statement, which would later be broken by Mike Gordon walking down to him and slowly clapping, which would lead to the entire audience erupted in applause."

Lines of people would wrap around polling stations as people were eager to vote for either Mark Gordon or Brad Little. By roughly 7pm, neary every man and woman were proudly brandishing “I Voted” badges that had not been worn in years. Barbeques were held, fireworks were lit and the streets of every neighborhood were teeming with smiling faces and hopeful people. A site like this has not been seen in years as this election was so different from previous ones. This election did not feel like choosing between the lesser of two evils. This election would not pit neighbor against neighbor or cause any division. Either man was seen as the right man for the job and it would be a hopeful future for either administration. As votes were tallied up, Lincolnites were glued to their televisions and phones to watch the polls. It may have been an extremely close election, but it was an election that would see more unity than division like those of the past."
