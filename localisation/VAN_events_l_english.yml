#A Canadian Contender
 vancouver.0.t:0 "The Vancouver Army"
 vancouver.0.d:0 "With the outbreak of the Canadian Civil War, soldiers on duty forced to fight on the front lines have gone completely AWOL. In Vancouver, the story is very different, though. Many soldiers of the 3rd Canadian Division have flocked to the area in the search of a more fair society. These troops have willingly joined the Vancouver force and are ready to defend its territory until their death. The process of integrating the remaining 3rd Canadian Division soldiers has begun and has served as a major piece of propaganda for the fledgling state of Vancouver. This has caused an influx of volunteers to help defend Vancouver, blostering the ranks of the army."
