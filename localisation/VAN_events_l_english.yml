#A Canadian Contender
 vancouver.0.t:0 "The Vancouver Army"
 vancouver.0.d:0 "With the outbreak of the Canadian Civil War, soldiers on duty forced to fight on the front lines have gone completely AWOL. In Vancouver, the story is very different, though. Many soldiers of the 3rd Canadian Division have flocked to the area in the search of a more fair society. These troops have willingly joined the Vancouver force and are ready to defend its territory until their death. The process of integrating the remaining 3rd Canadian Division soldiers has begun and has served as a major piece of propaganda for the fledgling state of Vancouver. This has caused an influx of volunteers to help defend Vancouver, blostering the ranks of the army."

#Western Canadian Convention Event
 vancouver.1.t:0 "The Western Canadian Convention"
 vancouver.1.d:0 "Following the collapse of Trudeau’s government and rising tensions along political borders, we called for a convention among the Canadian pretenders in western Canada to determine the fate of the west. Given our political differences, coming to an agreement on foreign and domestic policy could prove troublesome. Should we collaborate with our political rivals or carve our own path forward?"

#MARPAC
 vancouver.2.t:0 "The Maritime Forces Pacific"

Due to our control over Victoria Island and subsequently CFB Esquimalt, the MARPAC's main base of operations, we have naturally inherited the MARPAC and its command staff."
 vancouver.2.a:0 "Anchors Aweigh!"
 
#The Vancouver Terror
 vancouver.3.t:0 "The Vancouver Terror"
 vancouver.3.d:0 "Our government’s increasing acceptance of authoritarian policies have swayed the public squarely against us. This past month has seen a near constant riot in the streets in protest of our government. As a result, we have deployed the national guard to pacify the protesters, resulting in thousands of deaths after responding to riots with deadly force, and raiding the homes of those suspected of inciting violence and instability. “All our progress, every slightly significant achievement we have made in socialist construction, has been the expression and result of our domestic class struggle.” - Joseph Stalin"
 vancouver.3.a:0 "It will work this time."
