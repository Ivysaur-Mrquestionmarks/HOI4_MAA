 #EVENTS

 Dixie.1.t:0 "Debug"
 Dixie.1.d:0 "Bro wtf how did you get this. Anyways i'll use this event to shout out NazBol Ronald Reagan, Aero, Ivysaur, MexicanBias for their constant and consitant help for the mod. -Anarcho-Clintonism Bill Clinton."
 Dixie.1.a:0 "Three Cheers to the MAA Dev Team!"
 Dixie.2.t:0 "Opening of the Electoral Season"
 Dixie.2.d:0 "After Governor Kemp relinquished his emergency powers and initiated free elections, many candidates are now eyeing up the ticket to lead  the Republic of Dixie. The most notable Democratic candidates include former representative Gene Taylor and former senator Jim Webb. The most notable Republican candidates include notorious former senator Tom Cotton, former United States Marine and youngest recipient of the Medal of Honor Kyle Carpenter, and notorious southern musical artist Hank Williams Jr. in his late 70s. Finally, running as self-proclaimed ''Sons of the South'' are John Betram-Davis, the descendent of the famed Jefferson Davis, Paul Thurmond, and George Wallace Jr., children of notable civil rights era segregationists Strom Thurmond and George Wallace respectively. There are also brewing rumors that voters want Brian Kemp to return as the elected president, however these are nothing but rumors of course. Who shall Dixie choose in their first election?"
 Dixie.2.a:0 "I can't wait!"
 Dixie.3.t:0 "A Vote From Home..."
 Dixie.3.d:0 "Despite the controversy of mail-in voting since the 2020 election, which contributed to the outbreak of the 2nd American Civil War, the Dixie legislature was able to swiftly pass through laws permitting mail-in voting across the nation for the upcoming election due to the sheer amount of casualties of the southern civil war, which included politicians. The decision met very light opposition from extreme right-wing voters around the nation, however more leftist and moderate voters were fine with the legalization. What will this mean for the upcoming election?"
 Dixie.3.a:0 "...Is Still a Vote"
 dixie.4.t:0 "Sweet Home Alabama"
 dixie.4.d:0 "The State of Alabama has a prominent conservative electoral history. However, with controversy springing back in the Alabama Senate Special Election in 2017, Democratic candidate Doug Jones was able to come up with the electoral victory after his opponent Roy Moore had multiple sexual assault allegations against him, becoming the first Democrat since 1997 to be an Alabama senator. He was replaced in the 2020 election by Republican Tommy Tuberville for a short time before Tuberville lost his seat amongst the chaos of the 2nd American Civil War. Primarily considered a safe conservative state, a victory here by the Republicans or the Dixiecrats would be expected; however, votes being split amongst the conservative parties could lead the Democrats to carry Alabama, as long as they can properly appeal to the moderate voters in the state."
 dixie.4.a:0 "Wallace Jr. fills the shoes of Dear Ol' Dad."
 dixie.4.b:0 "The Two-Party Divide Remains"
 dixie.4.c:0 "Alabama Loves the Federalists!"
 dixie.4.e:0 "Conservatism Lives On!"
 dixie.5.t:0 "Regnat Populus"
 dixie.5.d:0 "The State of Arkansas, positioned down the Mississippi River to the north of Louisiana, has always been a reliably conservative state like many others in the south, however politically they had voted Democrats into their house and senate up until around 2010. What was considered a safe Republican state in the last few elections of the United States, it's still very likely to vote for a Republican candidate, especially being the home state of former Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, who is one of the prominent Republican candidates. If the Dixiecrats are able to compete in Arkansas and appeal to conservative voters in the state, then the Democrats could swoop in and possibly grab the moderate vote due to possible Republican-Dixiecrat vote splitting."
 dixie.5.a:0 "The Most Solid of the South!"
 dixie.5.b:0 "It's either Blue or Red!"
 dixie.5.c:0 "The People Rule Indeed!"
 dixie.5.e:0 "Cotton Sweeps his Homestate"
 dixie.6.t:0 "A Divided, Destroyed State"
 dixie.6.d:0 "Positioned where the Mississippi River meets the Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana once encompassed the hub of French culture and people in the United States before years of American culture swept that to the side. Louisiana is home to New Orleans, which on its own could swing Louisiana left or right in this upcoming election. The Republicans and Dixiecrats need to appeal to the usual conservative voters which have carried the state to Republican victories since the 2000 election. The Democrats must hope that vote splitting occurs among the right, and they're able to appeal to inner-city voters in New Orleans to secure a win in the state. Being the place of the most dangerous fighting during the Civil War, and only having half of his orgininal territory, Louisiana will certainly be a toss-up."
 dixie.6.a:0 "Thurmond 1948! Thurmond [GetYear]!"
 dixie.6.b:0 "Red or Blue, don't care who!"
 dixie.6.c:0 "The Gays still have Voting Rights!"
 dixie.6.e:0 "The Gay Rebellion left its Mark"
