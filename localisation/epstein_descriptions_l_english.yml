 DESC_LEADER_VERMIN_SUPREME:0 "Vermin Supreme's story is an odd one, and one that nobody would have believed but half a year ago. Becoming one third of the American Free State’s Triumvirate and leading a successful revolt from the G.L.A.R. probably wasn’t on his 2021 to-do list. But these are strange times, and sometimes strange times yield strange circumstances. In any case, Vermin Supreme found himself locked in a balancing act with the Triumvirate’s two other members.\n\nVermin also finds himself as the recognized “spokesman” of the Triumvirate due to AOC and Mattis seeing him as the least likely to be a threat, but Vermin isn’t a complete fool. He dreams of a truly free America, free from useless government bureaucracy, and he trusts neither Mattis nor AOC to deliver on that dream.\n\nSo Vermin Supreme, alone, walks his path towards his idea of true liberty for the people of the AFS. He knows things cannot go on forever like this, but his followers have put their faith in him.\n\nIn Supreme We Trust."

 DESC_LEADER_JAMES_MASON:0 "James Mason once said, "The Nazis cannot take power as long as the existing U.S. government remains in place."  Born in Chillicothe, Ohio, Mason grew fantasized with far-right and Neo-Nazi movements from a young age.  At age 14, he joined George Lincoln Rockwell's American Nazi Party.  Following this, he left the American Nazi Party and joined the National Socialist White People's Party.  Due to crimes he committed in his adulthood (including pepper spraying a group of African-American teenagers), Mason was constantly in and out of jail.  Once released, he helped co-found the Atomwaffen Division in 2015.  Once the United States collapsed, he gathered his loyal forces and hosted a meeting in Denver to plan the basis of his new Amerikareich, a state built on racial purity and Spartanism who would prepare for the inevitable race war that would determine the future of the white race."
 POLITICS_KANYE_WEST_DESC:0 "Kanye West, born in Atlanta, made in Chicago, and produced in New York City is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, businessman, politician, writer, psychopath, scammer, sell-out and fashion designer. Whether you're black, white, hispanic, or anything in between on this continent you will have a place for Kanye West in your heart, a uniting figure to all, you respect the man who defined the 2010s even when he makes dogshit meme albums in the early 2020s. However, as John Wilkes Booth had forseen centuries ago, the American people need chaos and instability to function and the 21st century is no different..."
