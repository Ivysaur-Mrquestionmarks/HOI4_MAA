 IDA_Militia_State_1:0 "Militia State"
 IDA_Militia_State_1_desc:0 "Being a state reliant on militias is a mixed bag. Though we enjoy a network of local connections and great knowledge of local geography, our pilots can't fly anything faster than a propeller plane, our soldiers can't handle most heavy weapon systems properly, and operating a proper tank is a pipe dream. Our forces are thoroughly unprepared to fight a modern war, and the sidelining of military officers has only exacerbated this problem.

 IDA_Economic_Dependence_2:0 "Dependent Industry - Increased Taxation"
 IDA_Economic_Dependence_2_desc:0 "Though it goes against some of our core beliefs, we have had no choice, but to increase taxes in order to fund basic government functions. Though this is incredibly unpopular among our population base, this will give us a bit of breathing room for now.\n§T----------------§!\n§YIncreasing taxation will greatly reduce our consumer goods, but we must look to territorial expansion if we are to solve our economic woes."
 IDA_Economic_Dependence_3:0 "Dependent Industry - Mobilized Economy" #Switches to War Economy
 IDA_Economic_Dependence_3_desc:0 "Though it won't be as immediately effective as increasing taxes, it is much more preferable to mobilize the populous, and our our economy for war.

 mark_gordon_desc:0 "Holding a Bachelor of Arts degree in history, Mark Gordon, to say the least, has had a rather lackluster career in politics. After a failed congressional run in 2008, he would eventually be elected as Treasurer of Wyoming, serving from 2012 to 2019.

 idaho_rework.2.d:0 "Out of all the things Stankiewicz thought he'd be doing when given control of the Western Command Zone, spending hours tucked behind a desk wasn't one of them. Though this type of work wasn't foreign to him (having been a production manager before the war) the sheer amount of paperwork that had to be done was absurd. Stankiewicz leaned back in his chair, he could use a nap, and it wasn't like the reports on his desk would be going anywhere. As he closed his eyes a secretary burst through the door. "Sir," the secretary said frantically, "you have a call coming in from Denver."\n\n"Is it the president?" replied a tired Stankiewicz.\n\n"Yes, sir."\n\n"Hand me the phone."\n\nThe secretary handed Stankiewicz the phone and he placed it up to his ear, sure enough, it was president Trump.\n\nStankiewicz shot up, "Mr. President," he said firmly.\n\nA familiar voice bellowed from the other end, "Commander Stankiewicz, how have you been doing?"\n\n"I've..." Stankiewicz paused for a moment, "been doing fine sir, and you?"\n\n"I've seen better days Stankiewicz, Pence and his traitorous entourage and what not," the president began trailing off before jumping back on topic. "Enough of that squabble, Stankiewicz, I have a job for you."\n\n"What is it sir?"\n\n"I want you to get your forces mobilized ASAP, and begin prepping for an invasion of Montana. My advisors have been telling me Bullock's in a tight spot right now, and now's the time to strike. Am I clear, commander?"\n\nA brief pause came and went before Stankiewicz replied, "Yes sir, I'll send out the mobilization order immediately."\n\n"Good..good..don't let me down commander, this country is depending on you."\n\n"Yes sir, you won't be disappointed.§!"\n\nThe phone hung up, and the secretary approached Stankiewicz, "Would you like me to send out the order sir?"\n\n"Yeah, go do that," Stankiewicz replied, "and get me a coffee as well, I have a feeling I'm going to need it."\n\n"As you wish sir."\n\nThe secretary exited the room, and Stankiewicz looked down at his desk.

 idaho_rework.17.t:0 "Weapons Shipment Raided!"

 idaho_rework.18.t:0 "Weapons Shipments Raided!"

 idaho_rework.19.t:0 "Raid Repelled"
 idaho_rework.19.d:0 "We've just received word that our troops have repelled a raid from agents of the Western Command Zone. Hopefully, this will dissuade future raids from occurring." 
 idaho_rework.19.a:0 "That'll teach them."
 idaho_rework.20.t:0 "Roads Blown!"
 idaho_rework.20.d:0 "A series of explosives were set off at strategic locations, along our highways and roadways across our state. This action will hurt our war effort against the Western Command Zone, while we get these roads fixed." 
 idaho_rework.20.a:0 "Underhanded tactics won't save them from us."
 idaho_rework.21.t:0 "Increased Militia Movement!"
 idaho_rework.21.d:0 "We've been getting reports that there's been a sudden increase in militia activity. It is very likely these groups are planning something big in the near future. We should take care to be prepared for any major events in the future."
 idaho_rework.21.a:0 "Worrying, to say the least."
 idaho_rework.22.t:0 "Massive Revolt!"

 idaho_rework.25.t:0 "Small Revolt!"
 idaho_rework.25.d:0 "It seems our worst fears have come to fruition, militias under the leadership of Ryan Payne and Chuck Baldwin have revolted against us. It seems around 20% of our forces have defected to their side. This situation is ideal, but we can still make a recovery if need be."

 DESC_LEADER_JEFF_STANKIEWICZ:0 "Hailing from Priest River, Idaho, Jeffery Stankiewicz was a welder and production supervisor in his professional life. After experiencing a period of unemployment in 2010, Stankiewicz founded the Idaho Light Foot Militia (ILFM) under the justification that Democrats were attempting to install a socialist dictatorship. Though he was reemployed by the start of 2011, Stankiewicz continued to lead, and expand, the ILFM, something that would prove vital in the coming decade."      
 DESC_LEADER_GARY_L_SAYLER:0 "Gary L. Sayler has had a rather successful career in the military. Hailing from the U.S. Air Force, Sayler was initially the commander of the 124th Wing at Gowen Field in Boise, Idaho from 1995 to 2004. Sayler would later become the Commander of Idaho's National Air Guard's Joint Force at Gowen Field until 2010 when he was appointed as Idaho's adjutant general, a position he held until 2017."

 DESC_LEADER_MELISSA_SUE_ROBINSON:0 "A transgender woman and advocate, Melissa Sue Robinson attempted to run for public office in Nampa, Idaho several times, but has been unsuccessful every single time. She had planned to run in the 2022 Idaho gubernatorial election, but the start of the civil war derailed those plans."
 DESC_LEADER_NATE_MARTIN:0 "Born and raised in Rock Springs, Wyoming, Nate Martin was a writer who worked in the industry for over 15 years. Aside from that, he having been the executive director of the activist group, Better Wyoming since 2017, and serving as a trustee on the Albany County School Board."
 DESC_LEADER_JOHN_EARLE_SULLIVAN:0 "If there is one thing that can be said about John Earle Sullivan, it is that he is an extremely militant, black rights activist from Utah. Aside from that, Sullivan has been accused of being both an agent for the left and the right, giving him a rather notorious reputation among the activist community."   
 DESC_LEADER_CHUCK_BALDWIN:0 "Chuck Baldwin is a pastor from Kalispell, Montana, and former chaplain for the Montanan Oath Keepers. Before his move to Montana, Baldwin was the founder, and pastor, of the Crossroad Baptist Church in Pensacola, Florida.

 # General Descriptions #
 DESC_GENERAL_JOHN_TIEGEN:0 "Before his time as a security contractor, John Tiegen served in the U.S. Marine Corp for four years, ultimately obtaining the rank of sergeant. Of course, he is best known for his role in the 2012 Battle of Benghazi, where he (and other security contractors) helped defend a U.S. compound from Islamic militants."
 DESC_GENERAL_BOONE_TIDWELL:0 "Boone Tidwell had a long career before the start of the civil war.

Tidwell launched an unsuccessful campaign to become Park County Commissioner in 2016, and helped establish a group to protect Cody residents from rioters in 2020." 
 DESC_GENERAL_BRANDON_CURTISS:0 "Former founder of the 3% of Idaho, Brandon Curtiss was disgraced after being charged with grand theft for stealing money from his clients through his real estate company. Though these charges would have normally disqualified him from even joining the militia, his experience as a former police officer (and a desperate need for experienced commanders) lead to him being pardoned of his crimes, and given a command position in the Western Command Zone."
 DESC_GENERAL_COREY_COON:0 "Corey Coon's position as the police chief of Sandpoint, Idaho makes him one of the more unusual commanders of the Western Command Zone. When Stankiewicz and the Idaho Light Foot Militia began preparing the defense of northern Idaho, Coon's sympathies for the militias led him to offer the support of the Sandpoint Police Department."
 DESC_GENERAL_ERIC_PARKER:0 "Making a name for himself as the 'Bundy Ranch Sniper,' Eric Parker could be considered one of the more "inexperienced" commanders of the Western Command Zone due to being an electrician by trade, as well as having no experience in military or law enforcement.

 DESC_GENERAL_JOSHUA_WHEELER:0 "Joshua Wheeler is a veteran of the Wyoming National Guard, and was deployed to Iraq twice. During his deployments to Iraq, he suffered from several injuries (most notably a back injury that cut his second deployment short.)

 DESC_GENERAL_MARSHALL_BURT:0 "A veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, Marshall Burt could be considered one of the more unusual commanders of the Western Command Zone, considering he was technically a politician before the civil war. Burt, a Libertarian, was elected to represent Wyoming's 39th House of Representatives district for a short little while before the civil war started." 
 DESC_GENERAL_RYAN_PAYNE:0 "Ryan Payne is the head of operations at REM Technologies in Bozeman, Montana, but he is best known for his role in planning the Occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016 with Ammon Bundy. He was arrested, and plead guilty to a federal conspiracy charge in 2016. He served three years in prison, and was released in 2020 for good behavior."

 #DESC_GENERAL_JAMES_WESLEY_RAWLES:0 "A former U.S. Army Intelligence officer, James Welsey, Rawles (yes, the comma is intentional) is best known for being the author of the survivalist-genre 'Patriots' novel series. Aside from that, Rawles is also known for being a survivalist blogger, and proposing the idea of the American Redoubt (a proposed safe haven for conservative Christians and Jews located in the states of Idaho, Wyoming, Montana as well as Eastern Oregon and Washington.) Rawles' idea of the American Redoubt was put to the test when the civil war began. Though the forces of the redoubt were able to hold out for some time, the Montana National Guard eventually forced him, and many others, to flee south."
