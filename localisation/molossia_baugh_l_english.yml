MOL_the_issues_at_hand_desc:0 "Without a proper legal code, economy, or political system in place, we're at quite a fragile moment in our young nation's lifespan.

MOL_create_assembly:0 "Work with Community Leaders"
MOL_create_assembly_desc:0 "We are not yet ready to hold elections, but that should not stop us from seeking as much input from the Molossian citizenry as possibly.

MOL_dreams_of_monarchy_desc:0 "Sure, the idea sounds preposterous. Were Kevin Baugh to wake up today and announce that he was now \"King of Molossia\", he would probably be deposed on the spot.

MOL_a_central_position:0 "Baugh Takes Center Stage"
MOL_a_central_position_desc:0 "If Kevin Baugh is to ascend to the Molossian throne, he cannot simply be the figurehead he has been at times. He must be an active, insightful, and multi-talented leader who plays a lead role in guiding the Molossian state through the trouble surrounding it. It is time for President Baugh to up his level of personal responsibility and make himself irreplaceable."
