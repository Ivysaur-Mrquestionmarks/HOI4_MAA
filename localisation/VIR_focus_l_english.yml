 virginia.1.d:0 "Hunter wiped the sweat from his brow as he sat in the waiting room. He had no idea as to why his father had called him to his office, but he was almost certain he wasn't going to like it. His arms began to itch. Before long, it felt like a swarm of fireants had taken over his body. But in the room full of military men and seasoned beaurocrats, he didn't dare give off just how badly his addiction was afflicting him. Nobody could know, least of all his father. So he just wiped the sweat from his forehead a second time.\n\nThe door opened. 'Come in, son.'. Whatever he was about to be told, he hoped it could be short so he could remedy his withdrawal symptoms.\n\n"Now, son, you know I love ya, and you know I've let you off from a lot, which is why I now think it's time you pay me back.". God, what does the old man want now? Some publicity trip? A speech? Looks like I was worried about nothing. "Northam's a great governor, but the Civil War has taken its toll on him. I'm not sure how long he's going to hold out. So I see an opportunity here. The Soul of America rests on me- and as my son, it rests on you. So I'm sending you to Virginia.". What?! Has he finally lost it? Why the fuck would he put me in charge of that frontline rural shithole?\n"Dad--"\n"Now I won't hear any objections from you, sonny, this will be a great experience for you, experience I think you'll find you'll need in the near future. Kiddo...""
