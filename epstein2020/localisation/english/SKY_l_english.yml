The men had been deployed to search for an missing supply convoy that went missing hours ago. The convoy was carrying high value weaponry and ammunition to the frontlines, although it seems that things didn’t go to plan. \n\nThe Mercenary and his men reached the top of a large hill in the middle of a field, the hill looking over a large portion of land around them. To the north of the group’s position were large pillars of smoke that rose high into the sky. \n\nSeeing the smoke in the distance the group quickly set out to reach the smoke in quick timing, reaching the position in less than half an hour. The convoy’s remains were laid across an once bustling highway, no one has ever dared to go against an highway convoy… at least not until now. The convoy… the entire convoy and surrounding fields burned brightly and hotly as whatever would’ve done this track’s were now gone. Although in the end it was obvious who would have the guts to commit such act…"
