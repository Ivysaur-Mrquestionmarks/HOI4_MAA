THESE FOCUS ICONS ARE PREMADE FROM GRESTINPACK
I DID NOT WANT TO PUT THE PREMADE ONES IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THE ONES MADE FOR THIS MOD FOR I HOPE OBVIOUS REASONS

in the interface file, the focus ids are exactly the same as the file names with GFX_goal infront of them. THIS INCLUDES FOCUS ICONS THAT ALREADY SAY focus_!!!

so, for example, GFX_goal_Focus_Julius_Caesar
